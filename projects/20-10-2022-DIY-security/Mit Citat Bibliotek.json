We describe how to estimate such cross-level interaction effects and distill the technical literature for a general readership of management researchers, including a description of the multilevel model building process and an illustration of analyses and results with a data set grounded in substantive theory. In addition, we provide 10 specific best-practice recommendations regarding persistent and important challenges that researchers face before and after data collection to improve the accuracy of substantive conclusions involving cross-level interaction effects. Our recommendations provide guidance on how to define the cross-level interaction effect, compute statistical power and make research design decisions, test hypotheses with various types of moderator variables (e.g., continuous, categorical), rescale (i.e., center) predictors, graph the cross-level interaction effect, interpret interactions given the symmetrical nature of such effects, test multiple cross-level interaction hypotheses, test cross-level interactions involving more than two levels of nesting, compute effect-size estimates and interpret the practical importance of a cross-level interaction effect, and report results regarding the multilevel model building process.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,9,10]]},"author":[{"family":"Aguinis","given":"Herman"},{"family":"Gottfredson","given":"Ryan K."},{"family":"Culpepper","given":"Steven Andrew"}],"citation-key":"Aguinis.etal2013","container-title":"Journal of Management","container-title-short":"Journal of Management","DOI":"10.1177/0149206313478188","ISSN":"0149-2063, 1557-1211","issue":"6","issued":{"date-parts":[[2013,9]]},"language":"en","page":"1490-1528","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Best-Practice Recommendations for Estimating Cross-Level Interaction Effects Using Multilevel Modeling","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0149206313478188","volume":"39"},

We test the hypothesis that traditional agricultural practices influenced the historical gender division of labor and the evolution of gender norms. We find that, consistent with existing hypotheses, the descendants of societies that traditionally practiced plough agriculture today have less equal gender norms, measured using reported gender-role attitudes and female participation in the workplace, politics, and entrepreneurial activities. Our results hold looking across countries, across districts within countries, and across ethnicities within districts. To test for the importance of cultural persistence, we examine the children of immigrants living in Europe and the United States.

This method—which has been implemented in both Stata and LIMDEP—does not in fact control for all stable covariates. Three alternative methods are explored. A negative multinomial model yields the same estimator as the conditional Poisson estimator and hence does not provide any additional leverage for dealing with over-dispersion. On the other hand, a simulation study yields good results from applying an unconditional negative binomial regression estimator with dummy variables to represent the fixed effects. There is no evidence for any incidental parameters bias in the coefficients, and downward bias in the standard error estimates can be easily and effectively corrected using the deviance statistic. Finally, an approximate conditional method is found to perform at about the same level as the unconditional estimator.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,9,10]]},"author":[{"family":"Allison","given":"Paul D."},{"family":"Waterman","given":"Richard P."}],"citation-key":"Allison.Waterman2002","container-title":"Sociological Methodology","container-title-short":"Sociological Methodology","DOI":"10.1111/1467-9531.00117","ISSN":"0081-1750, 1467-9531","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2002,8]]},"language":"en","page":"247-265","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"7.

This paper examines the selectivity of government decisions to use militias by disaggregating civil conflict to the level of battle phases. Civil-conflict battles typically consist of four phases: preparation, clear, hold, and build. I argue that governments decide to use militias based on the strength of government security forces, operational advantages of militias, and the type of battle phase. Governments will limit the use of militias during key battle phases that are likely to receive increased media attention unless a victory secured by government security forces is unlikely or militias hold an operational advantage. A comparative analysis of the offensive operations in Tikrit and Ramadi during Iraq’s war against the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) lends initial support to this theory.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,4,21]]},"author":[{"family":"Ambrozik","given":"Caitlin"}],"citation-key":"Ambrozik2019","container-title":"Security Studies","container-title-short":"Security Studies","DOI":"10.1080/09636412.2019.1662479","ISSN":"0963-6412, 1556-1852","issue":"5","issued":{"date-parts":[[2019,10,20]]},"language":"en","page":"870-900","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Not Whether, But When?

It seeks to clarify the complex intersections between formal and informal, state and non-state security actors, and the varied terrains on which hybridity is constructed, instrumentalised and recalibrated over time. Rather than romanticising informal or ‘traditional’ institutions, it suggests that they too embed their own power hierarchies, become sites of contestation, and do not work equally well for everyone, least of all for the weak, vulnerable and excluded. Thus the focus is placed upon the real governance of security in hybrid systems, and the patterns of inclusion and exclusion (including gender biases) they reinforce. Finally the paper considers how policy-makers and shapers can work with the grain of hybrid security arrangements to create more legitimate, broadly-based and effective African security governance.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,4,21]]},"author":[{"family":"Bagayoko","given":"Niagale"},{"family":"Hutchful","given":"Eboe"},{"family":"Luckham","given":"Robin"}],"citation-key":"Bagayoko.etal2016","container-title":"Conflict, Security & Development","container-title-short":"Conflict, Security & Development","DOI":"10.1080/14678802.2016.1136137","ISSN":"1467-8802, 1478-1174","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2016,1,2]]},"language":"en","page":"1-32","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Hybrid security governance in Africa: rethinking the foundations of security, justice and legitimate public authority","title-short":"Hybrid security governance in Africa","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/14678802.2016.1136137","volume":"16"},

Traditional political institutions are often assumed to be unaccountable because they are led by undemocratic leaders who are not subject to electoral sanctioning. However, drawing on new information from the TradGov Group dataset, an expert survey on the contemporary practices of more than 1,400 ethnic groups that currently have traditional political institutions, we show that these institutions contain their own distinct mechanisms of accountability. In a majority of cases, decision-making is consensual and leaders must account for their actions in various ways. We challenge the electoral accountability framework for understanding the quality of traditional leaders’ performance, instead arguing that traditional political institutions can be compatible with democracy and even accountable to their citizens insofar as they adopt inclusive decisionmaking processes and their leaders have strong nonelectoral connections to the communities they represent.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,6,17]]},"author":[{"family":"Baldwin","given":"Kate"},{"family":"Holzinger","given":"Katharina"}],"citation-key":"Baldwin.Holzinger2019","container-title":"Comparative Political Studies","container-title-short":"Comparative Political Studies","DOI":"10.1177/0010414019852686","ISSN":"0010-4140, 1552-3829","issue":"12","issued":{"date-parts":[[2019,10]]},"language":"en","page":"1747-1774","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Traditional Political Institutions and Democracy: Reassessing Their Compatibility and Accountability","title-short":"Traditional Political Institutions and Democracy","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0010414019852686","volume":"52"},

The authors test the external validity of the experimental findings by examining the effects of introducing elections in an indigenous institution in Liberia. They use a break in the process of selecting clan chiefs at the end of Liberia’s civil wars to identify the effects of elections on collective action within communities. Drawing on survey data and outcomes from behavioral games, the authors find that the introduction of elections for clan chiefs has little effect on community-level and national-level political participation but that it increases contentious collective action and lowers levels of contributions to public goods. These findings provide an important counterpoint to the experimental literature, suggesting that elections have less salutary effects on collective action when they replace customary practices.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,6,17]]},"author":[{"family":"Baldwin","given":"Kate"},{"family":"Mvukiyehe","given":"Eric"}],"citation-key":"Baldwin.Mvukiyehe2015","container-title":"World Politics","container-title-short":"World Pol.","DOI":"10.1017/S0043887115000210","ISSN":"0043-8871, 1086-3338","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[[2015,10]]},"language":"en","page":"690-725","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Elections and Collective Action: Evidence from Changes in Traditional Institutions in Liberia","title-short":"Elections and Collective Action","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.cambridge.org/core/product/identifier/S0043887115000210/type/journal_article","volume":"67"},

These data can be treated as panels in a longitudinal framework once it is recognised that the relevant variables (including the attitudes variables) can be handled eﬀectively as country-level averages. Multi-level modelling (the default approach in existing research) is not necessary; in particular, there is no need to use individuallevel control variables. In a ﬁxed-eﬀects analysis of country-level data, adoption of more open/accommodating integration and/or multiculturalism policies does not lead to a reduction in antiimmigration sentiment.

  {"id":"Belge2011","abstract":"Following the establishment of the Turkish Republic in 1923, the twin goals of centralizing state power and inscribing a uniform national identity on all citizens resulted in the proliferation of disciplinary practices that required changes in habits and everyday life as well as in the locus of faith, allegiance, and obedience. Nowhere were the repercussions felt as deeply as in the Kurdish regions, where the urge to create a new citizen sparked considerable resistance. This article suggests that alongside Kurdish nationalist movements, kinship networks and morality constituted an alternative reservoir of resistance to the new disciplinary practices that followed state building.

Using multilevel models, we find that when the effect of debt on growth is allowed to vary, and linear time trends are fully controlled for, the average effect of debt on growth disappears, whilst countryspecific debt relations vary significantly. Additionally, countries with high debt levels appear more volatile in their growth rates. Regarding causality, we develop a new method extending distributed lag models to multilevel situations. These models suggest the causal direction is predominantly growth-to-debt, and is consistent (with some exceptions) across countries.

Given the confusion in the literature about the key properties of fixed and random effects (FE and RE) models, we present these models’ capabilities and limitations. We also discuss the within-between RE model, sometimes misleadingly labelled a ‘hybrid’ model, showing that it is the most general of the three, with all the strengths of the other two. As such, and because it allows for important extensions—notably random slopes—we argue it should be used (as a starting point at least) in all multilevel analyses. We develop the argument through simulations, evaluating how these models cope with some likely mis-specifications. These simulations reveal that (1) failing to include random slopes can generate anticonservative standard errors, and (2) assuming random intercepts are Normally distributed, when they are not, introduces only modest biases. These results strengthen the case for the use of, and need for, these models.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,9,10]]},"author":[{"family":"Bell","given":"Andrew"},{"family":"Fairbrother","given":"Malcolm"},{"family":"Jones","given":"Kelvyn"}],"citation-key":"Bell.etal2019","container-title":"Quality & Quantity","container-title-short":"Qual Quant","DOI":"10.1007/s11135-018-0802-x","ISSN":"0033-5177, 1573-7845","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[[2019,3]]},"language":"en","page":"1051-1074","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Fixed and random effects models: making an informed choice","title-short":"Fixed and random effects models","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s11135-018-0802-x","volume":"53"},

Results show that factors beyond the expectation of economic beneﬁts inﬂuence the development of cooperative behaviour, including embedded social relationships, which provide a basis for sanctions. However, the absence of clear allocation rules and of secure property rights discourages sustained contribution of inputs. The study also ﬁnds that the contribution, and the ultimate beneﬁts gained, by the members of the group are dependent on limited technological options and other attributes of the water-points they manage. Interestingly, divergence of interests (between economic elites and poor herders) in institutional change precluding the establishment of cisterns negatively affects the livelihoods of the poor (agro) pastoralists. Where internal capacity is limited, assisted collective action that builds on diverse local interests could contribute to sustainable management of collectively used water-points.

Blair\n              et al\n              . report the results of a large-scale experiment testing the effectiveness of this approach across six countries in the Southern Hemisphere (see the Perspective by Tobon). They found that such community engagement did not increase trust in the police and it did not reduce crime. Improving relationships between police and community may require deeper structural changes before or in addition to approaches such as community policing. —SNV\n            \n          , \n            Community policing may not improve police community relations in all contexts.\n          , \n            \n              INTRODUCTION\n              More than one-fourth of the world’s population lives in conditions of insecurity because of high levels of crime and violence, especially in the Global South. Although the police are central to reducing crime and violence, they are also often perpetrators of unjust harm against citizens. We investigated the effects of community policing, a set of practices designed to build trust between citizens and police, increase the co-production of public safety, and reduce crime. Community policing is meant to improve outcomes by increasing engagement between citizens and police through increased foot patrols, community meetings, and the adoption of problem-oriented policing strategies that address concerns raised by citizens. When cooperation leads to effective police responses, this approach reinforces citizen trust and facilitates further cooperation, creating a virtuous cycle. Community policing has been implemented around the world on every continent. However, although there is evidence for its positive effects in rich countries, there is no systematic evidence about whether community policing effectively generates trust and reduces crime in the Global South.\n            \n            \n              RATIONALE\n              Working in partnership with local police agencies, we conducted six coordinated field experiments in Brazil, Colombia, Liberia, Pakistan, the Philippines, and Uganda. We collaborated with the police to implement locally appropriate increases in community policing practices. We planned for risks involved in partnering with the police by soliciting reports of police abuse and carefully selecting the areas we worked in and the police units we partnered with. We randomly assigned areas to either the community policing practices or a control group. Our interventions reached approximately 9 million people in 516 treated areas. At end line, we surveyed 18,382 citizens and 874 police officers and obtained crime data from the police. We conducted experiments in multiple settings with common measures to strengthen the generalizability of our findings and preregistered a joint analysis of the six studies to reduce the risk of publication bias.\n            \n            \n              RESULTS\n              Increases in locally appropriate community policing practices led to no improvements in citizen-police trust, no greater citizen cooperation with the police, and no reduction in crime in any of the six sites. Despite a strong commitment from leadership in each context at the outset, the police implemented the interventions unevenly and incompletely. Although citizens reported more frequent and robust exposure to the police in places where community policing was implemented, we have limited evidence of police action in response to citizen reports. Three implementation challenges common to police reforms may have contributed to these disappointing results: a lack of sustained buy-in from police leadership, frequent rotation of police leadership and their officers, and a lack of resources to respond to issues raised by citizens.\n            \n            \n              CONCLUSION\n              At a time when police departments around the world are considering reform efforts to foster greater trust between citizens and the police, it is more important than ever to ask hard questions about the evidence base for the most popular reform proposals. In contexts with limited incentives and resources to change, the results of our coordinated experiments deliver a clear message. Community policing does not, at least immediately and on its own, lead to major improvements in citizen-police relations or reductions in crime. Structural reforms to the police may be needed to successfully reduce crime while building greater police accountability to citizens.\n              \n                \n                  Evaluating community policing.\n                  In six field experiments across the Global South conducted in partnership with local police agencies, we assessed the effectiveness of community policing. We found that community policing does not improve citizen-police trust or cooperation and does not reduce crime.\n                \n                \n              \n            \n          , \n            Is it possible to reduce crime without exacerbating adversarial relationships between police and citizens? Community policing is a celebrated reform with that aim, which is now adopted on six continents. However, the evidence base is limited, studying reform components in isolation in a limited set of countries, and remaining largely silent on citizen-police trust. We designed six field experiments with Global South police agencies to study locally designed models of community policing using coordinated measures of crime and the attitudes and behaviors of citizens and police.

  {"id":"Boas2019a","abstract":"The crisis in the Sahel is serious and multidimensional, and if it continues unabated it could have consequences far beyond the region. As the states of the region are too poor and weak to deal with this on their own, international support is needed. It is therefore a positive sign that the region of Sahel is higher on the international agenda than it has ever been. The challenge, however, is that current international approaches and interventions in the Sahel are more in line with short-term external priorities, such as stopping irregular migration to Europe and fighting insurgencies that have been defined as part of a global complex of jihadist terrorism. There is no doubt that there is a migration crisis in the Sahel and we do need a military approach to several of the insurgencies. However, it must be part of a much broader agenda of humanitarian assistance and development support that is context and conflict sensitive. This policy dialogue addresses the root causes of the Sahel crisis and shows how the situation has evolved over time. The current crisis is deeply rooted in historical circumstances that external stakeholders cannot ignore. The main area of focus for the report is the epicentre of the current conflict, which is located in and around Mali, but which may have several important ramifications for the neighbouring G5 Sahel countries of Burkina Faso, Mauritania and Niger.\"","author":[{"family":"Bøås","given":"Morten"}],"citation-key":"Boas2019a","ISBN":"978-91-7106-859-0","issued":{"date-parts":[[2019]]},"language":"en","note":"OCLC: 1141861514","source":"Open WorldCat","title":"The Sahel crisis and the need for international support","type":"book"},

However, it is unclear what determines states’ selection of these auxiliary forces, and our understanding of how auxiliary force structures develop remains limited. The crucial difference between the two auxiliary types is their embeddedness in official structures. Paramilitaries are organized under the government to support/replace the regular military, whereas PGMs exist outside the state apparatus. Within a principal–agent framework, we argue that a state’s investment in a particular auxiliary force structure is shaped by available resources and capacity, accountability/deniability, and domestic threats. Our results based on quantitative analysis from 1981 to 2007 find that (a) state capacity is crucial for sustaining paramilitaries, but not PGMs; (b) PGMs, unlike paramilitaries, are more common in states involved in civil conflict; and (c) although both paramilitaries and PGMs are associated with regime instability, there is no significant difference between them in that context.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,4,21]]},"author":[{"family":"Böhmelt","given":"Tobias"},{"family":"Clayton","given":"Govinda"}],"citation-key":"Bohmelt.Clayton2018","container-title":"Comparative Political Studies","container-title-short":"Comparative Political Studies","DOI":"10.1177/0010414017699204","ISSN":"0010-4140, 1552-3829","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[[2018,2]]},"language":"en","page":"197-237","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Auxiliary Force Structure: Paramilitary Forces and Progovernment Militias","title-short":"Auxiliary Force Structure","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0010414017699204","volume":"51"},

  {"id":"Branovic.Chojnacki2011","abstract":"This article presents a theoretical framework with which to discuss how non-state modes of security governance evolve in the context of state failure and/or collapse. To address this issue, we present the logic of security markets, which assumes that the evolution of security governance by non-state groups in failed states is a function of both resource availability and the strategies that armed groups apply to extract resources from the civilian population. Axiomatically, we expect that in the short term the central purpose for the use of force is survival and achieving the ability to finance one’s capabilities to use force, although ultimately this also includes the seizure and control of territory. The main argument is that the changing competitive conditions in security markets – which we measure in terms of the total number of violent groups and their organizational design, size and strength – explain the rationales behind the decisions of armed groups either to use violence against the civilian population or to invest in the provision of security.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,4,21]]},"author":[{"family":"Branović","given":"Željko"},{"family":"Chojnacki","given":"Sven"}],"citation-key":"Branovic.Chojnacki2011","container-title":"Security Dialogue","container-title-short":"Security Dialogue","DOI":"10.1177/0967010611424423","ISSN":"0967-0106, 1460-3640","issue":"6","issued":{"date-parts":[[2011,12]]},"language":"en","page":"553-569","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"The logic of security markets: Security governance in failed states","title-short":"The logic of security markets","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0967010611424423","volume":"42"},

The discussion shows how the synoptic efforts to grapple with the ‘big picture’ are often undermined by the operational nitty-gritty of donor agency procedures and aid delivery mechanisms on the ground.

The running of rural infrastructure maintenance projects constructed upon village land generally involves two major problems, which are the lack of institutional rules and a weakening relationship between village cadres and farmers. By extending the IAD Framework, this paper studies how institutional rules, cadre-farmer relationships and their interaction term affect farmer willingness to maintain infrastructure. When involving the utilization and governance of public resources such as collective land, both local resource endowment and farmers’ will­ ingness should be fully considered. The results show that institutional rules and good cadre-farmer relationships can both significantly improve farmer willingness, and strengthen the positive effect of institutional rules on farmer willingness. However, the introduction of the interaction term renders institutional rules insignificant, showing that a good cadre-farmer relationship is necessary for ensuring institutional rules take effect. The results are robust after controlling village heterogeneity. Furthermore, we identify two mechanisms underlying suc­ cessful cadre-farmer relationships. The first is cadres mobilizing farmers to participate, and the second is enabling farmers to have a better understanding and recognition of institutional rules, thus improving their willingness to participate in rural infrastructure maintenance. This paper concludes by discussing how these findings point to new policy prescriptions surrounding the tragedy of the commons and tragedy of the anticommons.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,5,4]]},"author":[{"family":"Cao","given":"Yu"},{"family":"Zhang","given":"Xiaoling"},{"family":"He","given":"Lingxiao"}],"citation-key":"Cao.etal2020","container-title":"Land Use Policy","container-title-short":"Land Use Policy","DOI":"10.1016/j.landusepol.2020.105043","ISSN":"02648377","issued":{"date-parts":[[2020,12]]},"language":"en","page":"105043","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Collective Action in maintaining rural infrastructures: cadre-farmer relationship, institution rules and their interaction terms","title-short":"Collective Action in maintaining rural infrastructures","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0264837716312728","volume":"99"},
  {"id":"Carey.etal2013","abstract":"This article introduces the global Pro-Government Militias Database (PGMD). Despite the devastating record of some pro-government groups, there has been little research on why these forces form, under what conditions they are most likely to act, and how they affect the risk of internal conflict, repression, and state fragility. From events in the former Yugoslavia, Iraq, Sudan, or Syria and the countries of the Arab Spring we know that pro-government militias operate in a variety of contexts. They are often linked with extreme violence and disregard for the laws of war. Yet research, notably quantitative research, lags behind events. In this article we give an overview of the PGMD, a new global dataset that identifies pro-government militias from 1981 to 2007. The information on pro-government militias (PGMs) is presented in a relational data structure, which allows researchers to browse and download different versions of the dataset and access over 3,500 sources that informed the coding. The database shows the wide proliferation and diffusion of these groups. We identify 332 PGMs and specify how they are linked to government, for example via the governing political party, individual leaders, or the military. The dataset captures the type of affiliation of the groups to the government by distinguishing between informal and semi-official militias. It identifies, among others, membership characteristics and the types of groups they target. These data are likely to be relevant to research on state strength and state failure, the dynamics of conflict, including security sector reform, demobilization and reintegration, as well as work on human rights and the interactions between different state and non-state actors. To illustrate uses of the data, we include the PGM data in a standard model of armed conflict and find that such groups increase the risk of civil war.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,4,21]]},"author":[{"family":"Carey","given":"Sabine C"},{"family":"Mitchell","given":"Neil J"},{"family":"Lowe","given":"Will"}],"citation-key":"Carey.etal2013","container-title":"Journal of Peace Research","container-title-short":"Journal of Peace Research","DOI":"10.1177/0022343312464881","ISSN":"0022-3433, 1460-3578","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[[2013,3]]},"language":"en","page":"249-258","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"States, the security sector, and the monopoly of violence: A new database on pro-government militias","title-short":"States, the security sector, and the monopoly of violence","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0022343312464881","volume":"50"},

Building on research that suggests these groups offer governments logistical benefits in civil wars as well as political benefits in the form of reduced liability for violence, we provide the first systematic global analysis of the scale and patterns of these informal linkages. We find over 200 informal state–militia relationships across the globe, within but also outside of civil wars. We illustrate how informal delegation of violence to these groups can help some governments avoid accountability for violence and repression. Our empirical analysis finds that weak democracies as well as recipients of financial aid from democracies are particularly likely to form informal ties with militias.

  {"id":"Chenoweth.Stephan2011","abstract":"For more than a century, from 1900 to 2006, campaigns of nonviolent resistance were more than twice as effective as their violent counterparts in achieving their stated goals. By attracting impressive support from citizens, whose activism takes the form of protests, boycotts, civil disobedience, and other forms of nonviolent noncooperation, these efforts help separate regimes from their main sources of power and produce remarkable results, even in Iran, Burma, the Philippines, and the Palestinian Territories.Combining statistical analysis with case studies of specific countries and territories, Erica Chenoweth and Maria J. Stephan detail the factors enabling such campaigns to succeed and, sometimes, causing them to fail. They find that nonviolent resistance presents fewer obstacles to moral and physical involvement and commitment, and that higher levels of participation contribute to enhanced resilience, greater opportunities for tactical innovation and civic disruption (and therefore less incentive for a regime to maintain its status quo), and shifts in loyalty among opponents' erstwhile supporters, including members of the military establishment. Chenoweth and Stephan conclude that successful nonviolent resistance ushers in more durable and internally peaceful democracies, which are less likely to regress into civil war. Presenting a rich, evidentiary argument, they originally and systematically compare violent and nonviolent outcomes in different historical periods and geographical contexts, debunking the myth that violence occurs because of structural and environmental factors and that it is necessary to achieve certain political goals. Instead, the authors discover, violent insurgency is rarely justifiable on strategic grounds.","author":[{"family":"Chenoweth","given":"Erica"},{"family":"Stephan","given":"Maria J."}],"citation-key":"Chenoweth.Stephan2011","ISBN":"978-0-231-52748-4","issued":{"date-parts":[[2011,8]]},"page":"320 Pages","publisher":"Columbia University Press","source":"Columbia University Press","title":"Why Civil Resistance Works: The Strategic Logic of Nonviolent Conflict","title-short":"Why Civil Resistance Works","type":"book"},

  {"id":"Chojnacki.Engels","abstract":"This paper reviews recent debates in peace and conflict studies on the theoretical and empirical integration of spatial categories. We examine three notable strands of research. The first consists of studies that analyze the influence of topography, borders, and resource availability on the occurrence of international and intra-state war. The second strand comprises recent studies in civil war research focusing on territory and territorial control. The third strand is the debate on so-called environmental conflicts. We argue that most studies in all three fields are limited to the analysis of allegedly external material influences on violent conflict, failing to take into account the social and political meaning of physical materiality. We examine how recent research methodologically deals with interrelated scales (local, national, global). We argue that an analysis of the relationship between space and conflict should encompass both the materiality of space and its social meaning, and that these two aspects find themselves in a mutually constitutive relationship. Spatial theory therefore provides a useful approach.","author":[{"family":"Chojnacki","given":"Sven"},{"family":"Engels","given":"Bettina"}],"citation-key":"Chojnacki.Engels","language":"en","page":"20","source":"Zotero","title":"Material Determinism and Beyond: Spatial Categories in the Study of Violent Conflict","type":"article-journal"},

While it is difficult to find proxies for grievances and opportunities, we find that political and social variables that are most obviously related to grievances have little explanatory power.

  {"id":"Cook.Webb2021","abstract":"Debate on the use of lagged dependent variables has a long history in political science. The latest contribution to this discussion is Wilkins ( , Political Science Research and Methods, , – ), which advocates the use of an ADL( , ) model when there is serial dependence in the outcome and disturbance. While this specification does oﬀer some insurance against serially correlated disturbances, this is never the best (linear unbiased estimator) approach and should not be pursued as a general strategy. First, this strategy is only appropriate when the data-generating process (DGP) actually implies a more parsimonious model. Second, when this is not the DGP—e.g., lags of the predictors have independent eﬀects—this strategy mischaracterizes the dynamic process. We clarify this issue and detail a Wald test that can be used to evaluate the appropriateness of the Wilkins approach. In general, we argue that researchers need to always: (i) ensure models are dynamically complete and (ii) test whether more restrictive models are appropriate.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,9,18]]},"author":[{"family":"Cook","given":"Scott J."},{"family":"Webb","given":"Clayton"}],"citation-key":"Cook.Webb2021","container-title":"Political Analysis","container-title-short":"Polit.

  {"id":"Corbane.etal2021","abstract":"Spatially consistent and up-to-date maps of human settlements are crucial for addressing policies related to urbanization and sustainability, especially in the era of an increasingly urbanized world. The availability of open and free Sentinel-2 data of the Copernicus Earth Observation program offers a new opportunity for wall-to-wall mapping of human settlements at a global scale. This paper presents a deep-learning-based framework for a fully automated extraction of built-up areas at a spatial resolution of 10 m from a global composite of Sentinel-2 imagery. A multi-neuro modeling methodology building on a simple Convolution Neural Networks architecture for pixel-wise image classiﬁcation of built-up areas is developed. The core features of the proposed model are the image patch of size 5 9 5 pixels adequate for describing built-up areas from Sentinel-2 imagery and the lightweight topology with a total number of 1,448,578 trainable parameters and 4 2D convolutional layers and 2 ﬂattened layers. The deployment of the model on the global Sentinel-2 image composite provides the most detailed and complete map reporting about built-up areas for reference year 2018. The validation of the results with an independent reference dataset of building footprints covering 277 sites across the world establishes the reliability of the built-up layer produced by the proposed framework and the model robustness. The results of this study contribute to cutting-edge research in the ﬁeld of automated built-up areas mapping from remote sensing data and establish a new reference layer for the analysis of the spatial distribution of human settlements across the rural–urban continuum.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,5,9]]},"author":[{"family":"Corbane","given":"Christina"},{"family":"Syrris","given":"Vasileios"},{"family":"Sabo","given":"Filip"},{"family":"Politis","given":"Panagiotis"},{"family":"Melchiorri","given":"Michele"},{"family":"Pesaresi","given":"Martino"},{"family":"Soille","given":"Pierre"},{"family":"Kemper","given":"Thomas"}],"citation-key":"Corbane.etal2021","container-title":"Neural Computing and Applications","container-title-short":"Neural Comput & Applic","DOI":"10.1007/s00521-020-05449-7","ISSN":"0941-0643, 1433-3058","issue":"12","issued":{"date-parts":[[2021,6]]},"language":"en","page":"6697-6720","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Convolutional neural networks for global human settlements mapping from Sentinel-2 satellite imagery","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://link.springer.com/10.1007/s00521-020-05449-7","volume":"33"},

About half of the states in the international system face some challenge related to self-determination today. Why do some states face these demands while others do not? We argue that ethno-national self-determination is one of many identities with which individuals can find affinity. While an international norm related to self-determination has developed globally, its use as a basis for political claims has diffused regionally. Diffusion of self-determination occurs through observation of others using self-determination as a basis of organization, generating a sense of legitimacy, sensitivity to related grievance, and perceptions of tangible benefits related to self-determination identification. We test this empirically on global data on self-determination claims from 1960 to 2005 and find evidence of spatial diffusion, suggesting that self-determination is, to some extent, contagious.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,4,21]]},"author":[{"family":"Cunningham","given":"Kathleen Gallagher"},{"family":"Sawyer","given":"Katherine"}],"citation-key":"Cunningham.Sawyer2017","container-title":"International Organization","container-title-short":"Int Org","DOI":"10.1017/S0020818317000200","ISSN":"0020-8183, 1531-5088","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[[2017]]},"language":"en","page":"585-604","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Is Self-determination Contagious?

  {"id":"DeJuan.Bank2015","abstract":"Many authoritarian regimes selectively provide critical segments of the population with privileged access to goods and services, expecting political support in return. This article is interested in the effects of this regime strategy: Is violent opposition less likely to occur in subnational regions bound to the ruling elite through such patron–client networks? For its empirical analysis, the article makes use of crowdsourcing data on the number and geospatial distribution of fatalities in the Syrian civil war from March 2011 to November 2012. In terms of selective goods provision, the focus is on the electricity sector. Satellite images of the earth at night are used to proxy spatial variations in the public distribution of electricity in times of power shortages. These data are complemented with information from the last Syrian population census of 2004. Estimations from fixed effect logit models lend support to the hypothesis that the risk of violence has been lower in subdistricts that have been favored by the ruling regime in terms of preferential access to material goods. This hypothesis is further corroborated with qualitative evidence from Syrian localities.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,5,9]]},"author":[{"family":"De Juan","given":"Alexander"},{"family":"Bank","given":"André"}],"citation-key":"DeJuan.Bank2015","container-title":"Journal of Peace Research","container-title-short":"Journal of Peace Research","DOI":"10.1177/0022343314559437","ISSN":"0022-3433, 1460-3578","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2015,1]]},"language":"en","page":"91-104","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"The Ba‘athist blackout?

In Kunduz province, Afghanistan, a wide range of militias have received money, weapons, training and political support through several US-funded militia programmes. While labelled as‘local self-defence forces’, the observable behaviour of these militias ranges from providing local governance services in the areas they control to preying upon the people they are supposed to guard. Through the analytical lens of multi-layered governance this article investigates how the external support of the United States has been adopted, manipulated, and/or diverted by local militias in Kunduz to serve their own agendas. While the militia support yielded short-term counterinsurgency gains, in the mid to long term, it has unintentionally undermined both the security needs of local populations in Kunduz and US strategic interests.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,4,21]]},"author":[{"family":"Dirkx","given":"Toon"}],"citation-key":"Dirkx2017","container-title":"Civil Wars","container-title-short":"Civil Wars","DOI":"10.1080/13698249.2017.1416851","ISSN":"1369-8249, 1743-968X","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[[2017,7,3]]},"language":"en","page":"377-401","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"The Unintended Consequences of US Support on Militia Governance in Kunduz Province, Afghanistan","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/13698249.2017.1416851","volume":"19"},

First, the paper presents the building blocks of any feature of spatial data (points, polygons, and raster) and the task of georeferencing. Second, the paper discusses what a spatial matrix (W ) is, its varieties and the assumptions we make when choosing one. Third, the paper introduces how to investigate spatial clustering through visualizations (e.g. maps) as well as statistical tests (e.g. Moran’s index). Fourth and finally, the paper explains how to model spatial relationships that are of substantive interest to some of our research questions.

  {"id":"Eck2014","abstract":"Common notions about the source of communal land conflict in Africa have long explained it as growing out of conditions of environmental scarcity. This article argues instead that the institutional structure of the legal system is central to understanding which countries are prone to experience communal land conflict. When competing customary and modern jurisdictions coexist in countries inhabited by mixed identity groups, the conflicting sources of legal authority lead to insecurity about which source of law will prevail. Because the source of law is contested, conflict parties cannot trust the legal system to predictably adjudicate disputes, which encourages the use of extrajudicial vigilante measures. Using new data on communal violence in West Africa, this argument is examined for the period 1990–2009. The results show that in countries where competing jurisdictions exist, communal land conflict is 200–350% more likely. These findings suggest that researchers should consider the role of legal institutions and processes in relation to social unrest and collective violence.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,9,24]]},"author":[{"family":"Eck","given":"Kristine"}],"citation-key":"Eck2014","container-title":"Journal of Peace Research","container-title-short":"Journal of Peace Research","DOI":"10.1177/0022343314522257","ISSN":"0022-3433, 1460-3578","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[[2014,7]]},"language":"en","page":"441-454","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"The law of the land: Communal conflict and legal authority","title-short":"The law of the land","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0022343314522257","volume":"51"},
  {"id":"Eck2015","abstract":"Why do regimes delegate authority over a territory to nonstate militias, in effect voluntarily sacrificing their monopoly over the use of violence? This article argues that two factors increase the probability of states delegating control to a proxy militia, namely, military purges and armed conflict. Military purges disrupt intelligence-gathering structures and the organizational capacity of the military. To counteract this disruption, military leaders subcontract the task of control and repression to allied militias that have the local intelligence skills necessary to manage the civilian population. This argument is conditioned by whether the state faces an armed insurgency in a given region since intelligence, control, and repression are needed most where the state is being challenged. This hypothesis is tested on unique data for all subnational regions within Myanmar during the period I962 to 2010 and finds that proxy militias are more likely to be raised in conflict areas after military purges.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,4,21]]},"author":[{"family":"Eck","given":"Kristine"}],"citation-key":"Eck2015","container-title":"Journal of Conflict Resolution","container-title-short":"Journal of Conflict Resolution","DOI":"10.1177/0022002715576746","ISSN":"0022-0027, 1552-8766","issue":"5","issued":{"date-parts":[[2015,8]]},"language":"en","page":"924-946","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Repression by Proxy: How Military Purges and Insurgency Impact the Delegation of Coercion","title-short":"Repression by Proxy","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0022002715576746","volume":"59"},

However, this decision is also costly, given that these self-defense groups may undermine control of its territory. This raises the question: why do governments cultivate self-defense militias when doing so risks that these militias will undermine their territorial control? Using a game theoretic model, we argue that states take this risk in order to prevent rebels from co-opting local populations, which in turn may shift power away from the government and toward the rebels. Governments strategically use civilian militias to raise the price rebels must pay for civilian cooperation, prevent rebels from harnessing a territory’s resources, and/or to deter rebels from challenging government control in key areas. Empirically, the model suggests states are likely to support the formation of self-defense militias in territory that may moderately improve the power of rebel groups, but not in areas that are either less valuable or areas that are critical to the government’s survival. These hypotheses are tested using data from the Colombian civil war from 1996 to 2008.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,4,21]]},"author":[{"family":"Estancona","given":"Chelsea"},{"family":"Bird","given":"Lucia"},{"family":"Hinkkainen","given":"Kaisa"},{"family":"Bapat","given":"Navin"}],"citation-key":"Estancona.etal2019","container-title":"International Interactions","container-title-short":"International Interactions","DOI":"10.1080/03050629.2019.1554570","ISSN":"0305-0629, 1547-7444","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[[2019,3,4]]},"language":"en","page":"215-266","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Civilian self-defense militias in civil war","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/03050629.2019.1554570","volume":"45"},

However, within farmer groups, the commitment of individual members can vary, as the expected net benefits are not the same for all individuals, and opportunities to free-ride exist. Since the benefits of collective action emerge primarily through the exploitation of economies of scale, low participation rates in joint activities may put a serious threat to the success and viability of farmer groups. This article investigates determinants of smallholder participation intensity and free-riding, using the example of banana groups in Kenya. The results suggest that family labor availability and previous benefits that members received through the groups positively influence their intensity of participation in group meetings and collective marketing. Free-riding can mostly be attributed to structural and institutional conditions, such as group size and the timing of payments. More diversified farmers are less likely to sell collectively. Since smallholders are often highly diversified in their agricultural activities, farmer groups should also diversify, focusing on more than a single crop.

  {"id":"Florea2020","abstract":"De facto states, such as Somaliland (Somalia), are unrecognized separatist enclaves that display characteristics of statehood but lack an international legal status. To acquire domestic and external legitimacy, these actors engage in a wide range of governance practices: they set up military and police forces; executive, legislative, and judicial branches; hospitals; schools; banks; or social security networks. In spite of the obvious gains that can be accrued through the establishment of a complex governance architecture, de facto states exhibit great variation in the range of statelike institutions that they build: some, like Luhansk People’s Republic (Ukraine), put together a rudimentary governance apparatus, while others, like Transnistria (Moldova), manage to construct a complex system of rule. What explains the variation in governance practices across these separatist enclaves? Using original data on governance institutions across all de facto states (1945–2016), this study offers an empirical examination of the key factors that shape separatists’ incentives to supply governance. The findings reveal that de facto state separatists are less likely to provide governance when they have access to lootable mineral resources but are more likely to do so when they receive external military support, when peacekeepers are present, when they have access to relatively immobile assets, when they adopt a Marxist ideology, and when they control the territory for a long time. The findings help us better understand the conditions under which armed nonstate actors supplant sovereign states as de facto authorities and successfully institutionalize their rule.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,4,21]]},"author":[{"family":"Florea","given":"Adrian"}],"citation-key":"Florea2020","container-title":"European Journal of International Relations","container-title-short":"European Journal of International Relations","DOI":"10.1177/1354066120919481","ISSN":"1354-0661, 1460-3713","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[[2020,12]]},"language":"en","page":"1004-1031","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Rebel governance in de facto states","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/1354066120919481","volume":"26"},

Most studies of recruitment of combatants focus on explaining the supply of fighters—who fights and what kinds of people volunteer to fight depending on the incentives offered. We know comparatively little about how the leaders of armed groups manage influxes of volunteers to ensure their quality. This article examines the questions of who recruits fighters, and how the capacities of recruiters affect the quality of the individuals who they recruit. The histories of three understudied civil militias in Sierra Leone are used to develop and refine a theory of screening in nonstate armed groups. Evidence from intensive fieldwork suggests that access to civilian information networks can allow the leaders of armed groups to successfully screen recruits and exclude low-quality types even when the pool of volunteers is flooded with opportunists.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,5,25]]},"author":[{"family":"Forney","given":"Jonathan Filip"}],"citation-key":"Forney2015","container-title":"Journal of Conflict Resolution","container-title-short":"Journal of Conflict Resolution","DOI":"10.1177/0022002715576752","ISSN":"0022-0027, 1552-8766","issue":"5","issued":{"date-parts":[[2015,8]]},"language":"en","page":"824-849","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Who Can We Trust with a Gun?

  {"id":"Frowd2022","abstract":"This article examines the rise of the koglweogo self-defence groups in Burkina Faso, developing an empirical analysis of their practices and a conceptual approach to their ambiguous status. The article describes the ‘koglweogos” rise since 2014, their growth across urban and rural areas in Burkina Faso, and their involvement in tasks from crime-fighting to counterterrorism. The article builds on the existing literature on vigilantism and security provision in African states and outlines a conceptual framework highlighting the koglweogos’ pursuit of recognition. The koglweogo toggle between overlapping ‘amateur’ and ‘professional’ repertoires of security discourse and practice, pursuing recognition as security professionals but also the autonomy and flexibility of working in the margins. This emphasizes the symbolic value, social and political contestability, discursive construction, and imaginaries of security whilst eschewing a state/non-state binary. The article draws on fieldwork carried out with multiple koglweogo groups to highlight their role as auxiliaries in global security governance, their production of security claims in the absence of recognition, their production of public authority, and their relationship of collaboration with and contestation of the state. The article concludes with reflections on the broader utility of the concept of ‘security amateur’ in Africa and further afield.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,10,14]]},"author":[{"family":"Frowd","given":"Philippe M"}],"citation-key":"Frowd2022","container-title":"African Affairs","DOI":"10.1093/afraf/adab033","ISSN":"0001-9909, 1468-2621","issue":"482","issued":{"date-parts":[[2022,3,7]]},"language":"en","page":"109-130","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"The Politics of Non-State Security Provision in Burkina Faso: Koglweogo Self-Defence Groups’ Ambiguous Pursuit of Recognition","title-short":"The Politics of Non-State Security Provision in Burkina Faso","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://academic.oup.com/afraf/article/121/482/109/6520328","volume":"121"},

Taking a “relational” perspective, this article examines how peasant militias in Ayacucho Department, although initially formed for the purpose of violently opposing Shining Path rebels, became engaged in governing their own “wartime social order” in which they organised, coordinated, regulated, and signified activities and behaviour for the collective good of their local communities.

The primary data used for this study was collected from the rainfall stations across Somaliland as well as climate data retrieved from CHIRPS gridded rainfall dataset. However, the main findings of the present study were; Somaliland is characterized by drought, which is known to have the most far-reaching impacts of all-natural disasters. This obvious challenge is most likely to aggravate due to slow progress in drought risk management, increased population and massive land degradation. The study also found a large-scale failure of the rains in 2016 Deyr season and have led to severe drought conditions across Somaliland, resulting in significant failure on growing season and record low vegetation. The most seriously affected areas in the current drought are the eastern regions. On the other hand, based on the available climatological data from the past, it clearly shows that Somaliland is likely to face extreme and widespread droughts in the coming years as climate change is anticipated to increase the intensity and frequency of drought. As a result, there is a clear need for increased and integrated efforts in drought mitigation to lessen the negative impacts of recurrent droughts.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,9,10]]},"author":[{"family":"G","given":"Abdulkadir"}],"citation-key":"G2017","container-title":"Journal of Climatology & Weather Forecasting","container-title-short":"J Climatol Weather Forecasting","DOI":"10.4172/2332-2594.1000204","ISSN":"23322594","issue":"02","issued":{"date-parts":[[2017]]},"language":"en","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Assessment of Drought Recurrence in Somaliland: Causes, Impacts and Mitigations","title-short":"Assessment of Drought Recurrence in Somaliland","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.omicsonline.org/open-access/assessment-of-drought-recurrence-in-somaliland-causes-impacts-andmitigations-2332-2594-1000204.php?aid=89503","volume":"05"},

Rather, rival militant networks provide the context in which these fragmented conflicts unfold. Alliances that emerge within this competitive landscape have the power to alter conflict trajectories and shape their outcomes. Yet patterns of interrebel cooperation are understudied. The existing scholarship on rebel alliances focuses on why rebels cooperate, but little attention is given to the composition of those alliances: with whom rebels cooperate. We explore how power, ideology, and state sponsorship can shape alliance choices in multiparty civil wars. Employing network analysis and an original data set of tactical cooperation among Syrian rebels, we find compelling evidence that ideological homophily is a primary driver of rebel collaboration. Our findings contribute to an emerging literature that reasserts the role of ideology in conflict processes.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,4,21]]},"author":[{"family":"Gade","given":"Emily Kalah"},{"family":"Gabbay","given":"Michael"},{"family":"Hafez","given":"Mohammed M."},{"family":"Kelly","given":"Zane"}],"citation-key":"Gade.etal2019","container-title":"Journal of Conflict Resolution","container-title-short":"Journal of Conflict Resolution","DOI":"10.1177/0022002719826234","ISSN":"0022-0027, 1552-8766","issue":"9","issued":{"date-parts":[[2019,10]]},"language":"en","page":"2071-2097","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Networks of Cooperation: Rebel Alliances in Fragmented Civil Wars","title-short":"Networks of Cooperation","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0022002719826234","volume":"63"},

  {"id":"Giesselmann.etal2021","abstract":"More than one million refugees migrated to Germany in 2015-2016. The increase in refugees was rapid, visible and controversial, and varied substantially across German districts. Therefore, the increase provides unique leverage for analyzing the consequences of immigration and ethnolinguistic heterogeneity. We innovatively focus on within-district/within-person change with individual-level panel data and precise measures of district-level refugee shares. Using the German Socio-Economic Panel 2009-2017, we analyze three-way (person, year and district) fixed effects models of five exclusionary beliefs and behaviors. At the national level, concerns about immigration and social cohesion and strong far right party support increased at the same time as refugee shares increased. However, district-level refugee shares are robustly negatively associated with concerns about immigration and (less robustly) with strong far right party support. They are also not associated with concerns about social cohesion, residential moves, or subjective fair tax rates. Interaction estimators reveal that where unemployment is high, there are positive relationships between refugee shares and concerns about immigration and residential moves. Aside from high unemployment districts however, the results mostly support contact theory, and contradict fractionalization and minority threat theories. Overall, rising district-level refugee shares reduced or at least did not heighten exclusionary beliefs and behaviors.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,9,10]]},"author":[{"family":"Giesselmann","given":"Marco"},{"family":"Brady","given":"David"},{"family":"Naujoks","given":"Tabea"}],"citation-key":"Giesselmann.etal2021","DOI":"10.5167/UZH-213557","issued":{"date-parts":[[2021]]},"language":"en","publisher":"WZB Berlin Social Science Center","source":"DOI.org (Datacite)","title":"The social consequences of the increase in refugees to Germany 2015-2016","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.zora.uzh.ch/id/eprint/213557"},
  {"id":"Giesselmann.Schmidt-Catran2019","abstract":"Multilevel models with persons nested in countries are increasingly popular in cross-country research. Recently, social scientists have started to analyze data with a three-level structure: persons at level 1, nested in year-specific country samples at level 2, nested in countries at level 3. By using a country fixed-effects estimator, or an alternative equivalent specification in a random-effects framework, this structure is increasingly used to estimate within-country effects in order to control for unobserved heterogeneity. For the main effects of country-level characteristics, such estimators have been shown to have desirable statistical properties. However, estimators of cross-level interactions in these models are not exhibiting these attractive properties: as algebraic transformations show, they are not independent of between-country variation and thus carry country-specific heterogeneity. Monte Carlo experiments consistently reveal the standard approaches to within estimation to provide biased estimates of cross-level interactions in the presence of an unobserved correlated moderator at the country level. To obtain an unbiased within-country estimator of a cross-level interaction, effect heterogeneity must be systematically controlled. By replicating a published analysis, we demonstrate the relevance of this extended country fixed-effects estimator in research practice. The intent of this article is to provide advice for multilevel practitioners, who will be increasingly confronted with the availability of pooled cross-sectional survey data.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,9,10]]},"author":[{"family":"Giesselmann","given":"Marco"},{"family":"Schmidt-Catran","given":"Alexander W."}],"citation-key":"Giesselmann.Schmidt-Catran2019","container-title":"Sociological Methodology","container-title-short":"Sociological Methodology","DOI":"10.1177/0081175018809150","ISSN":"0081-1750, 1467-9531","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2019,8]]},"language":"en","page":"190-219","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Getting the Within Estimator of Cross-Level Interactions in Multilevel Models with Pooled Cross-Sections: Why Country Dummies (Sometimes) Do Not Do the Job","title-short":"Getting the Within Estimator of Cross-Level Interactions in Multilevel Models with Pooled Cross-Sections","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0081175018809150","volume":"49"},

However, algebraic transformations reveal that this strategy does not yield a within-unit estimator. Instead, the standard FE interaction estimator reflects unit-level differences of the interacted variables. This property allows interactions of a time-constant variable and a time-varying variable in FE to be estimated but may yield unwanted results if both variables vary within units. In such cases, Monte Carlo experiments confirm that the standard FE estimator of x Á z is biased if x is correlated with an unobserved unit-specific moderator of z (or vice versa). A within estimator of an interaction can be obtained by first demeaning each variable and then demeaning their product. This “double-demeaned” estimator is not subject to bias caused by unobserved effect heterogeneity.

Using behavioural data from the Tsimane forager-horticulturalists of Bolivia and Nyangatom nomadic pastoralists of Ethiopia, we evaluate the traits of leaders and the contexts in which leadership becomes more institutional. We find that leaders tend to have more capital, in the form of age-related knowledge, body size or social connections. These attributes can reduce the costs leaders incur and increase the efficacy of leadership. Leadership becomes more institutional in domains of collective action, such as resolution of intragroup conflict, where collective action failure threatens group integrity.

We incorporate references to traditional authority to measure whether participants contribute more when traditional institutions are involved. We explicate and test two possible mechanisms through which traditional institutions might affect cooperation and mobilization: a horizontal mechanism driven by peer-to-peer effects; and a vertical mechanism driven by access to social hierarchies.

  {"id":"Gray1999","abstract":"Strategic Culture as Context: The First Generation of Theory Strikes Back’ takes the scholarly argument about the study, and meaning, of strategic culture to a new stage. Speciﬁcally, this article is a direct reply to recent criticisms of so-called ﬁrst-generation theorists of strategic culture. The author reconsiders both the subject of strategic culture, and what he ﬁrst wrote about it ﬁfteen and more years ago. He ﬁnds that although there is noteworthy room for improvement in what he wrote then, the recent theorising by Alastair Iain Johnston, in particular, rests upon a misunderstanding of the nature, character, and ‘working’ of strategic culture. Of particular note is the insistence by Johnston on a separation of ideas from behaviour, for the dominant purpose of developing falsiﬁable theory. ‘Strategic Culture as Context,’ therefore, revisits in some detail questions of deﬁnition, with particular reference to the ideas-behaviour nexus. The article proceeds both to register arguments that should advance understanding of how strategic culture ‘works,’ and to suggest a better set of discriminators, different perspectives, for better consideration of evidence of strategic culture. Overall, the article suggests that strategic culture provides context for understanding, rather than explanatory causality for behaviour.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,5,10]]},"author":[{"family":"Gray","given":"Colin S."}],"citation-key":"Gray1999","container-title":"Review of International Studies","container-title-short":"Rev.

  {"id":"Habyarimana.etal2009","abstract":"Ethnically homogenous communities often do a better job than diverse communities of producing public goods such as satisfactory schools and health care, adequate sanitation, and low levels of crime. Coethnicity reports the results of a landmark study that aimed to find out why diversity has this cooperation-undermining effect. The study, conducted in a neighborhood of Kampala, Uganda, notable for both its high levels of diversity and low levels of public goods provision, hones in on the mechanisms that might account for the difficulties diverse societies often face in trying to act collectively. The Mulago-Kyebando Community Study uses behavioral games to explore how the ethnicity of the person with whom one is interacting shapes social behavior. Hundreds of local participants interacted with various partners in laboratory games simulating real-life decisions involving the allocation of money and the completion of joint tasks. Many of the subsequent findings debunk long-standing explanations for diversity’s adverse effects. Contrary to the prevalent notion that shared preferences facilitate ethnic collective action, differences in goals and priorities among participants were not found to be structured along ethnic lines. Nor was there evidence that subjects favored the welfare of their coethnics over that of non-coethnics. When given the opportunity to act altruistically, individuals did not choose to benefit coethnics disproportionately when their actions were anonymous. Yet when anonymity was removed, subjects behaved very differently. With their actions publicly observed, subjects gave significantly more to coethnics, expected their partners to reciprocate, and expected that they would be sanctioned for a failure to cooperate. This effect was most pronounced among individuals who were otherwise least likely to cooperate. These results suggest that what may look like ethnic favoritism is, in fact, a set of reciprocity norms—stronger among coethnics than among non-coethnics—that make it possible for members of more homogeneous communities to take risks, invest, and cooperate without the fear of getting cheated. Such norms may be more subject to change than deeply held ethnic antipathies—a powerful finding for policymakers seeking to design social institutions in diverse societies. Research on ethnic diversity typically draws on either experimental research or field work. Coethnicity does both. By taking the crucial step from observation to experimentation, this study marks a major breakthrough in the study of ethnic diversity.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,6,6]]},"archive":"JSTOR","author":[{"family":"Habyarimana","given":"James"},{"family":"Humphreys","given":"Macartan"},{"family":"Posner","given":"Daniel N."},{"family":"Weinstein","given":"Jeremy M."}],"citation-key":"Habyarimana.etal2009","ISBN":"978-0-87154-420-9","issued":{"date-parts":[[2009]]},"publisher":"Russell Sage Foundation","title":"Coethnicity: diversity and the dilemmas of collective action","type":"book","URL":"http://www.jstor.org.ez.statsbiblioteket.dk:2048/stable/10.7758/9781610446389"},
  {"id":"Hagberg2018","abstract":"Political crises, terrorism, porous international boundaries, coups d’état, and socio-political upheavals all underline the need to rethink what security means in the Sahel region. While international and regional approaches to security still take predominantly military and macro-political perspectives, there is a need to ethnographically describe and analyse security from below. To this end, citizens’ own initiatives should be central to contemporary analyses of African peacemaking interventions. This article takes the growing and diverse movements of self-defence groups in Burkina Faso and Mali as a starting point for analysing how security can be ‘seen from below’, often in interaction with and sometimes even in outright contradiction with the rule of law. While local self-defence groups constitute a challenge to the rule of law, ethnographic fieldwork in Mali and Burkina Faso reveals a high degree of adaptability and flexibility of these movements. This article furthermore discusses methodological challenges when doing ethnographic research in dangerous terrains, drawing on fieldwork in the Sahel, and considers implications of the study of ‘security from below’ for the wider study of international affairs.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,10,14]]},"author":[{"family":"Hagberg","given":"Sten"}],"citation-key":"Hagberg2018","container-title":"South African Journal of International Affairs","container-title-short":"South African Journal of International Affairs","DOI":"10.1080/10220461.2018.1417903","ISSN":"1022-0461, 1938-0275","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2018,1,2]]},"language":"en","page":"21-37","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Beyond regional radars: Security from below and the rule of law in the Sahel","title-short":"Beyond regional radars","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10220461.2018.1417903","volume":"25"},

In addition to a description of these movements, this comparative study of self-defense movements adds the important dimension of political rivalry and antagonism between the movements under study. First, it demonstrates how the state has tried to contain self-defense movements. Second, the emergence of koglweogos is analyzed with respect to public debate, as well as the state’s attempts to contain the movement bureaucratically.

In a ZIP model, a count response variable is assumed to be distributed as a mixture of a Poisson(A) distribution and a distribution with point mass of one at zero, with mixing probability p. Both p and A are allowed to depend on covariates through canonical link generalized linear models. In this paper, we adapt Lambert's methodology to an upper bounded count situation, thereby obtaining a zero-inflated binomial (ZIB) model. In addition, we add to the flexibility of these fixed effects models by incorporating random effects so that, e.g., the within-subject correlation and between-subject heterogeneity typical of repeated measures data can be accommodated. We motivate, develop, and illustrate the methods described here with an example from horticulture, where both upper bounded count (binomial-type) and unbounded count (Poisson-type) data with excess zeros were collected in a repeated measures designed experiment.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,9,10]]},"author":[{"family":"Hall","given":"Daniel B."}],"citation-key":"Hall2000","container-title":"Biometrics","DOI":"10.1111/j.0006-341X.2000.01030.x","ISSN":"0006341X","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[[2000,12]]},"language":"en","page":"1030-1039","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Zero-Inflated Poisson and Binomial Regression with Random Effects: A Case Study","title-short":"Zero-Inflated Poisson and Binomial Regression with Random Effects","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.0006-341X.2000.01030.x","volume":"56"},

Today, the use of remote sensing techniques and data is commonplace within many disciplines in the natural sciences. Although there are quite a few examples of remote sensing to be found in the social sciences, developments here have, on the whole, been less pronounced. This paper investigates 1) how remote sensing data has been put to use in social science studies, and 2) how social science could better utilize the huge potential of remote sensing data. The first part of the paper gives an overview of existing types of remote sensing techniques and data collection. The second part consistsof a review of social science applications of remote sensing data. In the conclusions it is argued that remote sensing data is at its most valuable in the social sciences when used in combination with traditional methods such as surveys, public records, interviews and direct observation.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,5,9]]},"author":[{"family":"Hall","given":"Ola"}],"citation-key":"Hall2010","container-title":"The Open Remote Sensing Journal","container-title-short":"TORMSJ","DOI":"10.2174/1875413901003010001","ISSN":"18754139","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2010,7,6]]},"language":"en","page":"1-16","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Remote Sensing in Social Science Research~!2009-12-28~!2010-03-26~!2010-06-25~!","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://benthamopen.com/ABSTRACT/TORMSJ-3-1","volume":"3"},

We show that these 2 concerns are actually addressing the same underlying issue. We discuss diverse modeling methods based on either multilevel regression modeling with the data in long format, or structural equation modeling with the data in wide format, and compare these approaches with simulated data. We extend the multilevel model with random slopes and discuss the consequences of this. Subsequently, we provide guidelines on how to choose between the diverse modeling options.

Our review of over 100 papers using MLM in political science, education, and sociology show that these “known” concerns have been widely ignored in practice. We describe how to debias MLM’s coefficient estimates, and provide an option to more flexibly estimate their standard errors. Most illuminating, once MLMs are adjusted in these two ways the point estimate and standard error for the target coefficient are exactly equal to those of the analogous FE model with cluster-robust standard errors. For investigators working with observational data and who are interested only in inference on the target coefficient, either approach is equally appropriate and preferable to uncorrected MLM.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,9,10]]},"author":[{"family":"Hazlett","given":"Chad"},{"family":"Wainstein","given":"Leonard"}],"citation-key":"Hazlett.Wainstein2022","container-title":"Political Analysis","container-title-short":"Polit.

Building on rational theories of constitution-making, we employ a demand and supply framework to explain the constitutionalization of such provisions. To test our hypotheses, we code the presence of indigenous provisions in the current constitutions of 193 United Nations member states. We find full democracy and previous conflict to stimulate the inclusion of indigenous group rights but not of customary law and traditional institutions. Customary law and traditional institutions are more likely constitutionalized in countries with high ethnic fractionalization. Low levels of modernity affect particularly the constitutionalization of traditional political institutions, while low levels of development correlate with provisions on customary law.

  {"id":"Huang.Sullivan2021","abstract":"How does foreign support for rebel groups affect rebel governance of civilians during armed conflict? Existing studies primarily examine the local and domestic politics of rebel rule, leaving the effects of foreign intervention on rebel governance underexplored. Focusing on rebel provision of social services, this study considers two competing arguments. The first suggests that foreign sponsorship reduces rebels’ need to rely on local civilians for resources and hence decreases rebels’ incentives to provide services. The second anticipates that by augmenting rebels’ resources and military capabilities, foreign support increases their capacity to provide welfare services. These competing logics suggest that different types of foreign support have divergent effects on rebel social service provision. The article tests this theory using cross-sectional time-series data on external support for rebel groups and rebel governance for the post-1945 period. It finds that rebel groups that receive external funding, weapons or training are significantly more likely to provide education and health services to civilians. In contrast, direct military intervention to assist insurgent forces has no effect on rebel service provision. This article is among the first to systematically study the impact of external support and third-party intervention on rebel social service provision during civil war and holds implications for civilian welfare in contested territories.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,4,21]]},"author":[{"family":"Huang","given":"Reyko"},{"family":"Sullivan","given":"Patricia L"}],"citation-key":"Huang.Sullivan2021","container-title":"Journal of Peace Research","container-title-short":"Journal of Peace Research","DOI":"10.1177/0022343320940749","ISSN":"0022-3433, 1460-3578","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[[2021,7]]},"language":"en","page":"794-808","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Arms for education?

Few studies have systematically examined how these conflicts affect public opinion, especially tolerance attitudes. Additionally, cross-national comparisons reveal significant differences in political tolerance levels but few explanations accounting for this variation. In this study, I bring together these disparate literatures and demonstrate the negative, independent effects of civil conflict on political tolerance levels across thirty-two countries. Examining data from the 1995–97 World Values Survey using several statistical techniques to ameliorate problems with endogeneity and multilevel data, I find that civil conflict dampens the public’s willingness to extend basic civil liberties to nonconformist groups.

  {"id":"IbrahimShire2022","abstract":"During civil wars, some communities raise self-defense militias to protect themselves from insurgent predation, but these militias can end up mutating into predatory organizations. The extant literature has focused chiefly on the predatory propensity of state-created self-defense militias and has mostly over­ looked why some community-created self-defense militias segue into predatory organizations while others eschew predation altogether. This study explains this phenomenon, drawing on in-depth interviews with active members of two community-created self-defense militias (Ahlu Sunna Waljama’a and Macawiisley) in Somalia. In doing so, two sequential mechanisms (sponsorship and mobility) that determine the propensity of predatory behavior are intro­ duced. Self-defense militias that conduct offensive operations engage in pre­ datory behavior, irrespective of whether they are sponsored locally or have external patrons. Externally sponsored self-defense militias that engage in offensive operations attract opportunistic recruits and become motivated by material benefits, while community-sponsored self-defense militias that con­ duct offensive operations instrumentalize their position to settle old scores against rival communities. By contrast, self-defense militias that restrict their operations to defensive activities typically recruit dedicated homegrown mem­ bers, and are regulated by community-managed accountability mechanisms that prevent predatory and abusive behavior. This community control remains crucial for defensive self-defense militias, who must balance external patrons’ strategic aims with their local objectives.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,4,21]]},"author":[{"family":"Ibrahim Shire","given":"Mohammed"}],"citation-key":"IbrahimShire2022","container-title":"Small Wars & Insurgencies","container-title-short":"Small Wars & Insurgencies","DOI":"10.1080/09592318.2021.1937806","ISSN":"0959-2318, 1743-9558","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[[2022,4,3]]},"language":"en","page":"467-498","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Protection or predation?

Recognizing that people’s behavior and values interact with the environment in which they live, analysis of overhead imagery can characterize geographic factors related to economic status, agricultural practice, and access to community resources in a region. Observables associated with economic well being include the presence of commercial infrastructure, house size, presence of vehicles, crop conditions, and access to transportation. The transportation and communication infrastructure also indicates the expected level of interactions among elements of the society. Other important factors may be inferred from indicators derived from the imagery, such as level and types of agricultural production, population density, access to improved roads, distances to schools and businesses, and attributes of communities. Using imagery data collected over rural Afghanistan, we present an initial case study of the direct and indirect indicators derived from the imagery. The methodology for extracting relevant measures from the imagery, through a mix of human-guided and machine learning methods, is demonstrated.

Satellite imagery can yield detailed local information about physical infrastructure, which we exploit for analysis of local socioeconomic conditions. Combining automated processing of satellite imagery with advanced modeling techniques provides a method for inferring measures of well-being, governance, and related sociocultural attributes from satellite imagery. This research represents a new approach to human geography by explicitly analyzing the relationship between observable physical attributes and societal characteristics and institutions of the region. Through analysis of commercial satellite imagery and Afrobarometer survey data, we have developed and demonstrated models for selected countries in sub-Saharan Africa (Botswana, Kenya, Zimbabwe). The findings show the potential for predicting people’s attitudes about the economy, security, leadership, social involvement, and related questions, based only on imagery-derived information. The approach pursued here builds on earlier work in Afghanistan. Models for predicting economic attributes (presence of key infrastructure, attitudes about the economy, perceptions of crime, and outlook toward the future) all exhibit statistically significant performance.

The identification strategy compares sites where a Chinese project was under implementation at the time of the interview to sites where a Chinese project will appear subsequently.

The persistent, and possibly battle-exacerbated, commitment problem can also alter the prospects of conflict termination.

Empirically, utilizing disaggregated data and statistical reweighting techniques, it isolates the causal eﬀect of aid provision on civil war battles in the targeted and adjacent localities in sub-Saharan Africa, at diﬀerent spatial and temporal scales. The empirical analysis provides considerable support for the argument by revealing that aid has a battle-escalating eﬀect in the targeted areas, while the same aid inﬂows into nearby localities negatively impact subsequent battle intensity.

Jentzsch shows that local military stalemates characterized by ongoing violence allow civilians to form militias that fight alongside the government against rebels. Militias spread only to communities in which elites are relatively unified, preventing elites from coopting militias for private gains. Crucially, militias that build on preexisting social conventions are able to resonate with the people and empower them to regain agency over their lives.

  {"id":"Jia.Petrick2014","abstract":"This article provides a deeper theoretical understanding of the linkages between land fragmentation and off-farm labor supply in China, and investigates this relationship empirically in a more direct way than does the existing literature. Drawing upon a rural household panel data set collected in Zhejiang, Hubei, and Yunnan Provinces from 1995 to 2002, we estimate the effects in two steps. First, we estimate the effect of land fragmentation on labor productivity. Second, we estimate the effect of land fragmentation on off-farm labor supply. The production function results show that land fragmentation indeed leads to lower agricultural labor productivity, implying that land consolidation will make on-farm work more attractive and thus decrease off-farm labor supply. However, the effect of land consolidation on off-farm labor supply is not signiﬁcant. One likely explanation for this result may be the potentially imperfect labor markets.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,5,9]]},"author":[{"family":"Jia","given":"Lili"},{"family":"Petrick","given":"Martin"}],"citation-key":"Jia.Petrick2014","container-title":"Agricultural Economics","container-title-short":"Agricultural Economics","DOI":"10.1111/agec.12071","ISSN":"01695150","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[[2014,5]]},"language":"en","page":"369-380","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"How does land fragmentation affect off-farm labor supply: panel data evidence from China","title-short":"How does land fragmentation affect off-farm labor supply","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/agec.12071","volume":"45"},

  {"id":"Kansanga.etal2020","abstract":"The pivotal role of social capital in smallholder agriculture is widely acknowledged. The growth eﬀect of social capital manifests in how networks and trust facilitate access to productive resources and knowledge sharing among farmers. While sub-Saharan Africa is considered a storehouse of rich social capital, recent literature indicates its rapid depletion due mainly to the rise of capitalist agriculture and concomitant reorganization of the relations of production that characterize smallholder agriculture. Agroecology is an alternative approach to agriculture aimed at addressing the adverse impacts of capitalist agriculture, including improving farmer-to-farmer networks. In this paper, we draw on longitudinal data from a ﬁve-year participatory agroecology intervention in Malawi using Diﬀerence-in-Diﬀerence (DID) to compare the social capital endowment of agroecology-practicing households (n = 514) and a control group of non-agroecology households (n = 400). We further employed linear regression to examine the relationship between social capital and agroecology adoption. Results from the DID analysis show a positive and statistically signiﬁcant change in mean social capital for participatory agroecology households (β = 0.325, p< 0.001) compared to non-agroecology households (β = 0.108) after accounting for theoretically relevant factors. Overall, the average treatment eﬀect of the intervention on social capital was positive (β = 0.217, p< 0.01). We also found a bidirectional relationship between social capital and adoption of agroecology practices (β = 0.12, p< 0.001). These ﬁndings reveal the positive inroads of agroecology beyond the farm-level and demonstrate the potential for policymakers to leverage these beneﬁts to promote sustainable agriculture.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,5,9]]},"author":[{"family":"Kansanga","given":"M.

Since the causes and structures of these governments vary considerably, they present an underexploited opportunity for comparative analysis. Building a subject area of rebel governance, as for any other ﬁeld, means ﬁnding its boundaries, determining which activities by insurgents amount to governance, deciding which structures and actions to include, and deciding the basis on which differences among them should be evaluated. The ﬁrst steps are to deﬁne rebel governance and establish the scope conditions that indicate which rebel organizations are capable of governing, whether they do so or not. A broad deﬁnition of rebel governance is organizing civilians for a public purpose. Three scope conditions are territorial control, a resident population, and violence or threat of violence. Insurgents who form governments organize civilian participation, civilian administration, or civilian production of wealth. Rebel governance sometimes results in rebel political order. The parameters of this new ﬁeld provide preliminary categories for identifying causes that shape rebel governance. The distinction between exogenous causes that lead rebels to begin civil wars and endogenous factors that affect rebels after their wars begin is probably one of the most important.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,4,21]]},"author":[{"family":"Kasfir","given":"Nelson"}],"citation-key":"Kasfir2015","container-title":"Rebel Governance in Civil War","DOI":"10.1017/CBO9781316182468.002","editor":[{"family":"Arjona","given":"Ana"},{"family":"Kasfir","given":"Nelson"},{"family":"Mampilly","given":"Zachariah"}],"event-place":"Cambridge","ISBN":"978-1-316-18246-8","issued":{"date-parts":[[2015]]},"language":"en","page":"21-46","publisher":"Cambridge University Press","publisher-place":"Cambridge","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Rebel Governance – Constructing a Field of Inquiry: Definitions, Scope, Patterns, Order, Causes","title-short":"Rebel Governance – Constructing a Field of Inquiry","type":"chapter","URL":"https://www.cambridge.org/core/product/identifier/9781316182468%23CN-bp-2/type/book_part"},

Whereas the extant literature has focused primarily on the statistical aspect of the problem, a comprehensive treatment requires an examination of theoretical and pragmatic considerations as complements. The prevailing problem with the focus on statistical techniques is that the standards tend to be derived from idealizations: the correlation between a regressor and a disturbance term must be exactly zero, or the analysis will be invalid. In actual empirical research settings, such a knife-edge assumption can never be satisﬁed, indeed it cannot even be directly tested. Idealizations are useful in helping us understand what it would take to eliminate endogeneity, but when applied directly and unconditionally, they lead to unreasonable standards that may unnecessarily stiﬂe substantive inquiry. We believe that it is far more productive and meaningful to ask: “What can we realistically expect empirical scientists to be able to achieve?” To this end, we cover and revisit some of the general technical material on endogeneity, paying special attention to the idiosyncrasies of operations management research and what could constitute reasonable criteria for addressing endogeneity in empirical operations management studies.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,9,10]]},"author":[{"family":"Ketokivi","given":"Mikko"},{"family":"McIntosh","given":"Cameron N."}],"citation-key":"Ketokivi.McIntosh2017","container-title":"Journal of Operations Management","container-title-short":"Journal of Operations Management","DOI":"10.1016/j.jom.2017.05.001","ISSN":"02726963","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2017,5]]},"language":"en","page":"1-14","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Addressing the endogeneity dilemma in operations management research: Theoretical, empirical, and pragmatic considerations","title-short":"Addressing the endogeneity dilemma in operations management research","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://doi.wiley.com/10.1016/j.jom.2017.05.001","volume":"52"},
  {"id":"Kibris2021","abstract":"Existing works on diffusion fail to account for the incapacitating effects conflict events may have on the operational capability of the combatant sides and how these effects may determine the evolution of a conflict. I hypothesize that it is those events with losses on the state side that are likely to be associated with geo-temporal spillovers, whereas events with insurgency losses are less likely to be associated with future mayhem in their vicinity. To test my arguments, I first introduce a new, comprehensive and detailed event dataset on the long-running civil conflict in Turkey. The Turkish State–PKK Conflict Event Database (TPCONED) includes the exact date and county-level location for the fatal events of the armed conflict between the Turkish state and the rebel organization PKK since its very beginning in 1984 with detailed information on combatant casualties. I then employ a split population bi-probit model which allows me to comprehensively depict the geotemporal evolution of the conflict by acknowledging, estimating and accounting for the variation in the underlying conflict proneness across locations as a latent variable that shapes the diffusion of events. The results of the statistical analyses offer support for my hypotheses and reveal that how events evolve over space and time is conditioned by the damages suffered by the combatant sides. I demonstrate the robustness of these results on a matched sample I obtain by employing the Coarsened Exact Matching (CEM) on the data.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,9,10]]},"author":[{"family":"Kibris","given":"Arzu"}],"citation-key":"Kibris2021","container-title":"Journal of Peace Research","container-title-short":"Journal of Peace Research","DOI":"10.1177/0022343320978695","ISSN":"0022-3433, 1460-3578","issue":"5","issued":{"date-parts":[[2021,9]]},"language":"en","page":"885-899","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"The geo-temporal evolution of violence in civil conflicts: A micro analysis of conflict diffusion on a new event data set","title-short":"The geo-temporal evolution of violence in civil conflicts","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0022343320978695","volume":"58"},

The danger of these extreme counterfactuals is that substantive conclusions drawn from statistical models that fit the data well turn out to be based largely on speculation hidden in convenient modeling assumptions that few would be willing to defend. Yet existing statistical strategies provide few reliable means of identifying extreme counterfactuals. We offer a proof that inferences farther from the data allow more model dependence and then develop easy-to-apply methods to evaluate how model dependent our answers would be to specified counterfactuals. These methods require neither sensitivity testing over specified classes of models nor evaluating any specific modeling assumptions. If an analysis fails the simple tests we offer, then we know that substantive results are sensitive to at least some modeling choices that are not based on empirical evidence.

Hence, we connect 92,762 Afrobarometer survey respondents to spatial data on 496 industrial mines. Using a difference-in-differences strategy, we find that mining increases bribe payments, and this result is robust to using alternative models. Mines are initially located in less corrupt areas, but mining areas turn more corrupt after mines open. When exploring mechanisms, we find that local economic activity relates differently to corruption in mining and non-mining areas, suggesting that mining income incentivizes and enables local officials already present to require more bribes.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,5,9]]},"author":[{"family":"Knutsen","given":"Carl Henrik"},{"family":"Kotsadam","given":"Andreas"},{"family":"Olsen","given":"Eivind Hammersmark"},{"family":"Wig","given":"Tore"}],"citation-key":"Knutsen.etal2017","container-title":"American Journal of Political Science","container-title-short":"American Journal of Political Science","DOI":"10.1111/ajps.12268","ISSN":"0092-5853, 1540-5907","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[[2017,4]]},"language":"en","page":"320-334","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Mining and Local Corruption in Africa","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/ajps.12268","volume":"61"},

  {"id":"Lam.Ostrom2010","abstract":"Improving irrigation systems in Asian countries has been a high priority for the allocation of international aid. Substantial funds have been allocated to adopt the ‘‘best practices’’ of hiring external water engineers to construct modern systems to replace those that farmers built. These expensive investments have infrequently led to long-term improvement in the operation of irrigation systems in Asia. In this article, we examine the process and impact of an innovative irrigation assistance project that was initially undertaken in Nepal in the mid-1980s. We analyze data obtained over three time periods related to changes in system structure and performance over time. We trace the unfolding patterns of improved engineering infrastructure across time depending on the way it interacts with other factors to affect long-term irrigation performance. We examine some of the key variables that are likely to affect the diverse and complex patterns of change. We also undertake analysis of the conﬁgural impact of core variables using Qualitative Comparative Analysis (QCA). We ﬁnd that the initial and later investments in system infrastructure are only one factor that helps to generate short-term improvement. Unless farmers encourage local entrepreneurs and organize themselves, create their own rules or use sanctions, and augment their rules through collective action, infrastructure investment alone is not sufﬁcient to achieve sustainable higher performance.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,5,31]]},"author":[{"family":"Lam","given":"Wai Fung"},{"family":"Ostrom","given":"Elinor"}],"citation-key":"Lam.Ostrom2010","container-title":"Policy Sciences","container-title-short":"Policy Sci","DOI":"10.1007/s11077-009-9082-6","ISSN":"0032-2687, 1573-0891","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2010,3]]},"language":"en","page":"1-25","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Analyzing the dynamic complexity of development interventions: lessons from an irrigation experiment in Nepal","title-short":"Analyzing the dynamic complexity of development interventions","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s11077-009-9082-6","volume":"43"},
  {"id":"Lar2019","abstract":"Nigeria’s Northwest region, while not suffering from the scourge of the Boko Haram insurgency, does have its own serious security challenges. The cocktail of insecurity in the area consists of farmer-pastoralist conflicts and rural banditry. While exploring the drivers of such conflicts across Nigeria’s Northwest landscape, the article explores the resilience of specific local institutions and actors, particularly community-based vigilante groups in responding to violent threats. Frustrated with what they regard as the nonchalant attitude of the state and security institutions, chieftaincy and traditional institutions within the affected areas have made attempts to respond to insecurity. A key manifestation of this mobilization is the organization of vigilante groups at the forefront of community self-defense and security efforts. The article argues that studying the response of these communities provides a better understanding of how local actors cope with and, collectively, create a measure of order and security. In this regard, the resilience of local institutions and people in communities in Northwest Nigeria helps to explain how they respond and adjust to a complex and fluid landscape of insecurity.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,10,15]]},"author":[{"literal":"Lar"}],"citation-key":"Lar2019","container-title":"African Conflict and Peacebuilding Review","container-title-short":"African Conflict and Peacebuilding Review","DOI":"10.2979/africonfpeacrevi.9.2.07","ISSN":"2156695X","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[[2019]]},"language":"en","page":"123","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Violence and Insecurity in Northwest Nigeria: Exploring the Role and Resilience of Local Actors","title-short":"Violence and Insecurity in Northwest Nigeria","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.jstor.org/stable/10.2979/africonfpeacrevi.9.2.07","volume":"9"},

  {"id":"Lee.etal2006","abstract":"Count data with excess zeros relative to a Poisson distribution are common in many biomedical applications. A popular approach to the analysis of such data is to use a zero-inflated Poisson (ZIP) regression model. Often, because of the hierarchical study design or the data collection procedure, zero-inflation and lack of independence may occur simultaneously, which render the standard ZIP model inadequate. To account for the preponderance of zero counts and the inherent correlation of observations, a class of multi-level ZIP regression model with random effects is presented. Model fitting is facilitated using an expectation-maximization algorithm, whereas variance components are estimated via residual maximum likelihood estimating equations. A score test for zero-inflation is also presented. The multi-level ZIP model is then generalized to cope with a more complex correlation structure. Application to the analysis of correlated count data from a longitudinal infant feeding study illustrates the usefulness of the approach.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,9,10]]},"author":[{"family":"Lee","given":"Andy H."},{"family":"Wang","given":"Kui"},{"family":"Scott","given":"Jane A."},{"family":"Yau","given":"Kelvin K.W."},{"family":"McLachlan","given":"Geoffrey J."}],"citation-key":"Lee.etal2006","container-title":"Statistical Methods in Medical Research","container-title-short":"Stat Methods Med Res","DOI":"10.1191/0962280206sm429oa","ISSN":"0962-2802, 1477-0334","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2006,2]]},"language":"en","page":"47-61","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Multi-level zero-inflated Poisson regression modelling of correlated count data with excess zeros","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1191/0962280206sm429oa","volume":"15"},
  {"id":"Leonard2018","abstract":"In this IDS Bulletin we present fieldwork from articles covering the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Côte d’Ivoire, Sierra Leone, Mozambique and Somalia to show that assumptions derived from the classical social contract theorists frequently lead the international community astray as it attempts to rebuild these African states. The historical social contract for most Africans is not between the state and individuals but with communities. When it comes to security, there are two contracts and two bargains to consider instead of the single one of classical presumptions. The contracts are (i) community governance structures with local families; and (ii) the state with community governance systems, with supplemental ties to individuals. The bargains are (iii) the regime with the military; and (iv) the state with the international community. The military is frequently a source of predation on communities rather than of protection. The dynamics of these contracts and bargains can be in conflict with one another, leading to a situation where governance is multilevel and networked. The presence and importance of international actors in the networks changes policies and indirectly affects politics, but it does not threaten the integrity of the state as an institution itself, which instead is rooted in the processes of the other three compacts.Article first published January 2013, IDSB44.1.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,4,22]]},"author":[{"family":"Leonard","given":"David K."}],"citation-key":"Leonard2018","container-title":"IDS Bulletin","DOI":"10.19088/1968-2018.126","ISSN":"1759-5436","issue":"1A","issued":{"date-parts":[[2018,4,23]]},"language":"en","license":"Copyright (c) 2013 IDS Bulletin","number":"1A","source":"bulletin.ids.ac.uk","title":"Social Contracts, Networks and Security in Tropical Africa Conflict States: An Overview","title-short":"Social Contracts, Networks and Security in Tropical Africa Conflict States","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://bulletin.ids.ac.uk/","volume":"49"},

Many social scientists turn to panel data to address such questions of causal ordering. Yet even in longitudinal analyses, reverse causality threatens causal inference based on conventional panel models. Whereas the methodological literature has suggested various alternative solutions, these approaches face many criticisms, chief among them to be sensitive to the correct specification of temporal lags. Applied researchers are thus left with little guidance. Seeking to provide such guidance, we compare how different panel models perform under a range of different conditions. Our Monte Carlo simulations reveal that unlike conventional panel models, a cross-lagged panel model with fixed effects not only offers protection against bias arising from reverse causality under a wide range of conditions but also helps to circumvent the problem of misspecified temporal lags.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,9,18]]},"author":[{"family":"Leszczensky","given":"Lars"},{"family":"Wolbring","given":"Tobias"}],"citation-key":"Leszczensky.Wolbring2022","container-title":"Sociological Methods & Research","container-title-short":"Sociological Methods & Research","DOI":"10.1177/0049124119882473","ISSN":"0049-1241, 1552-8294","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[[2022,5]]},"language":"en","page":"837-865","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"How to Deal With Reverse Causality Using Panel Data?

  {"id":"Li.etal2020","abstract":"The remote sensing based mapping of land cover at extensive scales, e.g., of whole continents, is still a challenging task because of the need for sophisticated pipelines that combine every step from data acquisition to land cover classiﬁcation. Utilizing the Google Earth Engine (GEE), which provides a catalog of multi-source data and a cloud-based environment, this research generates a land cover map of the whole African continent at 10 m resolution. This land cover map could provide a large-scale base layer for a more detailed local climate zone mapping of urban areas, which lie in the focus of interest of many studies. In this regard, we provide a free download link for our land cover maps of African cities at the end of this paper. It is shown that our product has achieved an overall accuracy of 81% for ﬁve classes, which is superior to the existing 10 m land cover product FROM-GLC10 in detecting urban class in city areas and identifying the boundaries between trees and low plants in rural areas. The best data input conﬁgurations are carefully selected based on a comparison of results from different input sources, which include Sentinel-2, Landsat-8, Global Human Settlement Layer (GHSL), Night Time Light (NTL) Data, Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM), and MODIS Land Surface Temperature (LST). We provide a further investigation of the importance of individual features derived from a Random Forest (RF) classiﬁer. In order to study the inﬂuence of sampling strategies on the land cover mapping performance, we have designed a transferability analysis experiment, which has not been adequately addressed in the current literature. In this experiment, we test whether trained models from several cities contain valuable information to classify a different city. It was found that samples of the urban class have better reusability than those of other natural land cover classes, i.e., trees, low plants, bare soil or sand, and water. After experimental evaluation of different land cover classes across different cities, we conclude that continental land cover mapping results can be considerably improved when training samples of natural land cover classes are collected and combined from areas covering each Köppen climate zone.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,5,9]]},"author":[{"family":"Li","given":"Qingyu"},{"family":"Qiu","given":"Chunping"},{"family":"Ma","given":"Lei"},{"family":"Schmitt","given":"Michael"},{"family":"Zhu","given":"Xiao"}],"citation-key":"Li.etal2020","container-title":"Remote Sensing","container-title-short":"Remote Sensing","DOI":"10.3390/rs12040602","ISSN":"2072-4292","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[[2020,2,11]]},"language":"en","page":"602","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Mapping the Land Cover of Africa at 10 m Resolution from Multi-Source Remote Sensing Data with Google Earth Engine","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.mdpi.com/2072-4292/12/4/602","volume":"12"},

Most recently, scholarly attention has focused on the interplay between religiosity and local actors, events, and institutions. Until now, measures of religiosity have relied heavily on selfreports in surveys, but these cannot always be safely collected and tend to be costly. Even where available, survey-based measures may be too obtrusive and are rarely representative of sub-national units. Here, I propose an inexpensive method that uses satellite imagery to unobtrusively estimate religiosity across small geographic units. I hypothesize that night-lights are affected by the behavior of fasting Muslims during Ramadan, especially in places where daytime activities are otherwise unchanged (i.e., where there is no “day-night inversion”). I explore and confirm the validity of this measurement strategy in the Turkish case, using a series of high-quality surveys and electoral results, representing 973 administrative districts. I conclude with a discussion of the external validity of this method and an overview of the ethical concerns raised by the use of remote sensing to estimate religiosity, in the Muslim world and elsewhere.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,5,9]]},"author":[{"family":"Livny","given":"Avital"}],"citation-key":"Livny2021","container-title":"Public Opinion Quarterly","DOI":"10.1093/poq/nfab013","ISSN":"0033-362X, 1537-5331","issue":"S1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2021,9,26]]},"language":"en","page":"371-398","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Can Religiosity be Sensed with Satellite Data?

In each area, we draw attention to the lessons already learned, interrogate key assumptions in existing work, raise arguments that remain under- or uninvestigated, and focus on the next frontier in the exploration of rebel governance.

Judicial processes are one avenue through which this cooperation and compliance can be secured. These efforts encompass a range of processes including ad hoc trials, truth commissions and commissions of inquiry, offers of amnesty, and reparations programs.

I argue for a more empirical and comparative approach to hybrid governance that is capable of distinguishing between constructive and corrosive forms of non-state order, and sharpens rather than blurs the relationship between formal and informal regulation. A critique of the theoretical and methodological issues surrounding hybrid governance perspectives sets the scene for a comparative analysis of two contrasting situations of hybrid security systems: the RCD-ML of eastern DR Congo, and the Bakassi Boys vigilante group of eastern Nigeria. In each case, four issues are examined: the basis of claims that regulatory authority has shifted to informal security systems; the local legitimacy of the security forces involved; the wider political context; and ﬁnally, whether a genuine transformation of regulatory authority has resulted, offering local populations a preferable alternative to the prior situation of neglectful or predatory rule. I argue that hybrid governance perspectives often essentialize informal regulatory systems, disguising coercion and political capture as popular legitimacy, and I echo calls for a more historically and empirically informed analysis of hybrid governance contexts.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,4,21]]},"author":[{"family":"Meagher","given":"Kate"}],"citation-key":"Meagher2012","container-title":"Development and Change","DOI":"10.1111/j.1467-7660.2012.01794.x","ISSN":"0012155X","issue":"5","issued":{"date-parts":[[2012,9]]},"language":"en","page":"1073-1101","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"The Strength of Weak States?

  {"id":"Mengisteab2013","abstract":"The Horn of Africa is a deeply troubled region engulfed in three interlocking crises. The first is a security crisis characterized by a range of devastating inter-state and inter-communal conflicts, including civil wars. The second is an economic crisis, evidenced by widespread debilitating poverty, chronic food insecurity, and frequent cycles of famines. The effects of the third - environmental - crisis are all too visible in the droughts, deforestation and desertification ravaging the region. What is more, these three crises are mutually reinforcing locking the region into a cycle of disaster. Conflicts contribute to poverty, which in turn intensifies environmental degradation, leading to scarcities which fuel further conflicts.   In this clear and authoritative guide, Kidane Mengisteab explores the key drivers of instability in the Horn of Africa, suggesting structural and institutional changes that - if implemented - could help lift the region out of crisis. The Horn’s complex crises must be tackled in a comprehensive manner. But, he contends, this can only be achieved if the causes of conflict are addressed head-on. Without peace, the region cannot resolve its economic problems, and nor can it develop the capabilities required to cope with environmental change.   The Horn of Africa will be essential reading for students and scholars in conflict and security studies, as well as anyone with an interest in learning more about the dynamics of this troubled region","author":[{"family":"Mengisteab","given":"Kidane"}],"citation-key":"Mengisteab2013","edition":"1st edition","event-place":"Cambridge, UK ; Malden, MA","ISBN":"978-0-7456-5122-4","issued":{"date-parts":[[2013,12,4]]},"language":"English","number-of-pages":"240","publisher":"Polity","publisher-place":"Cambridge, UK ; Malden, MA","source":"Amazon","title":"The Horn of Africa","type":"book"},

  {"id":"Miller2005","abstract":"▪ Abstract  With tools borrowed from the economic analysis of insurance, principal-agency theory has allowed political scientists new insights into the role of information asymmetry and incentives in political relationships. It has given us a way to think formally about power as the modification of incentives to induce actions in the interests of the principal. Principal-agency theory has evolved significantly as political scientists have sought to make it more applicable to peculiarly political institutions. In congressional oversight of the bureaucracy, increasing emphasis has been placed on negotiation of administrative procedures, rather than the imposition of outcome-based incentives, as originally conceived. Awareness of the problem of credible commitment has impelled more dramatic reformulations, in which agents perform their function only when their interests conflict with those of the principal, and they are guaranteed some degree of autonomy.\n            The ‘political master’ finds himself in the position of the ‘dilettante’ who stands opposite the ‘expert,’ facing the trained official who stands within the management of administration.\n            ( Weber 1958 )","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,5,9]]},"author":[{"family":"Miller","given":"Gary J."}],"citation-key":"Miller2005","container-title":"Annual Review of Political Science","container-title-short":"Annu.

However, because existing datasets represent ethnic homelands using aggregate polygon features, they lack information on ethnic compositions at the local level. Addressing this gap, this article introduces the Spatially Interpolated Data on Ethnicity (SIDE) dataset, a collection of 253 near-continuous maps of local ethno-linguistic, religious and ethno-religious settlement patterns in 47 low- and middle-income countries. We create these data using spatial interpolation and machine learning methods to generalize the ethnicity-related information in the geo-coded Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS). For each DHS survey we provide the ethnic, religious and ethno-religious compositions of cells on a raster that covers the respective countries at a resolution of 30 arc-seconds. The resulting data are optimized for use with geographic information systems (GIS) software. Comparisons of SIDE with existing categorical datasets and district-level census data from Uganda and Senegal are used to assess the data’s accuracy. Finally, we use the new data to study the effects of local polarization between politically relevant ethnic groups, finding a positive effect on the risk of local violence such as riots and protests. However, local ethno-political polarization is not statistically associated with violent events pertaining to larger-scale processes such as civil wars.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,6,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Müller-Crepon","given":"Carl"},{"family":"Hunziker","given":"Philipp"}],"citation-key":"Muller-Crepon.Hunziker2018a","container-title":"Journal of Peace Research","container-title-short":"Journal of Peace Research","DOI":"10.1177/0022343318764254","ISSN":"0022-3433, 1460-3578","issue":"5","issued":{"date-parts":[[2018,9]]},"language":"en","page":"687-698","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"New spatial data on ethnicity: Introducing SIDE","title-short":"New spatial data on ethnicity","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0022343318764254","volume":"55"},

Credit spread is used to observe whether investors would like to pay a premium for GBs over CBs. This study uses panel data regression with hybrid model to analyse daily observations over the period 2016 to 2017. We employ Option-Adjusted spread (OAS) to measure the credit spreads of bonds while controlling for bond specific, macroeconomic and global factors that influence the spread. With the hybrid model used in the panel data analysis, we were able to capture the fixed-effects of variables in a random effect model. We find that GBs are traded at a premium of 63 basis points (BPS), compared with a comparable corporate bond issue. We find that the green label provides issuers an incentive to raise funds through issuing GBs while providing investors an opportunity to diversify their investments returns. Our findings provide several implications to the major stakeholders driving the GB market to scale up the market to finance the required level of global green investment needs. We stress an urgent need to support the growth of the GB market to achieve sustainable development through mitigating climate change challenges.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,9,10]]},"author":[{"family":"Nanayakkara","given":"Madurika"},{"family":"Colombage","given":"Sisira"}],"citation-key":"Nanayakkara.Colombage2019","container-title":"Applied Economics","container-title-short":"Applied Economics","DOI":"10.1080/00036846.2019.1591611","ISSN":"0003-6846, 1466-4283","issue":"40","issued":{"date-parts":[[2019,8,27]]},"language":"en","page":"4425-4437","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Do investors in Green Bond market pay a premium?

They govern subnational communities and diﬀer from nation states, both in their institutional set-up as well as in their legitimacy. Yet, we have little comparative knowledge on these political systems and, in particular, whether they can be described as democratic. In this article, we analyse the democraticness of TPS based on a new expert survey. Using conﬁrmatory factor analysis (CFA), we show that the more than 140 ethnic groups we analyse vary meaningfully in their democraticness. Measures of public preference input and of political process control contribute particularly to a latent measure of democraticness. Furthermore, we ﬁnd some indication for regionally interdependent institutions, with slightly more democratic systems in Southern Africa and less democratic systems in West Africa. Yet, no such interdependence exists between the state and the group level. Finally, we ﬁnd that more hierarchically organized political systems, kings, and chiefs, as well as those organized in segments, are on average less democratic, while the presence of elders is associated with higher levels of democraticness.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,6,17]]},"author":[{"family":"Neupert-Wentz","given":"Clara"},{"family":"Kromrey","given":"Daniela"},{"family":"Bayer","given":"Axel"}],"citation-key":"Neupert-Wentz.etal2022b","container-title":"Democratization","container-title-short":"Democratization","DOI":"10.1080/13510347.2021.1953476","ISSN":"1351-0347, 1743-890X","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[[2022,2,17]]},"language":"en","page":"296-319","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"The democraticness of traditional political systems in Africa","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/13510347.2021.1953476","volume":"29"},

  {"id":"neupert-wentza","abstract":"Leaders of ethnic groups employ different strategies to pursue demands for selfdetermination. While some act within conventional channels of political contestation, others choose nonconventional strategies, including violence and rebellion. We conceive of this as a result of bargaining between group and state and argue that both sides’ institutions affect the likelihood of escalation. Speciﬁcally, groups with traditional authorities have the capacity and incentives to escalate conﬂicts. Only when such institutions are matched with internal accountability mechanisms can groups credibly commit so that bargaining failure and thus conﬂict are less likely. Similarly, states with open elections can tie their hands more effectively, and constitutional regulations of traditional authorities formalize state-group interactions, which also mitigates the effect of traditional authorities on conﬂict. We use new global data on groups that demand self-determination, their traditional political institutions, and their strategy choice from 2005 to 2015. We ﬁnd support for our argument using various identiﬁcation and estimation approaches. Groups with traditional authorities are much more likely to use violence, a ﬁnding that is not sensitive to the omission of unobserved confounders. Furthermore, this relationship is moderated by group-level audience costs and the strategic environment provided by the state. Our ﬁndings advance new perspectives on the interactions of customary and national institutions in determining subnational conﬂict.","author":[{"family":"Neupert-Wentz","given":"Clara"},{"family":"Kelle","given":"Friederike Luise"}],"citation-key":"neupert-wentza","language":"en","page":"74","source":"Zotero","title":"Traditional Authorities and Strategies in Demands for Self-Determination","type":"article-journal"},

There are many types of collective action, and they cannot all be captured with the same formal model. Four types of models are reviewed: single-actor models which treat the \"group\" behavior as given; models of the interdependent aggregation of individual choices into collective action; models of the collective decisions of individuals with different interests; and models of the dynamic interactions among collective actors and their opponents. All models require simplifying assumptions about some aspects of a situation so that others may be addressed. Models of the aggregation of individual choices have shown the greatest recent growth, have employed a wide variety of assumptions about individual behavior and coordination mechanisms, have identified complex interaction effects of group heterogeneity, and generally exhibit thresholds, discontinuities, and internal group differentiation. Models of dynamic interactions require further development but promise to be enriched by accumulating empirical time series data on collective events. Greater attention is urged to technical issues of formal symbolic mathematical analysis, experimental design, response surface analysis, and technical problems in the reduction and presentation of complex interactions.","author":[{"family":"Oliver","given":"Pamela E"}],"citation-key":"Oliver1993","issued":{"date-parts":[[1993]]},"language":"en","page":"30","source":"Zotero","title":"Formal Models of Collective Action","type":"article-journal"},

These performances are significantly better than models that leverage OpenStreetMap or nighttime light intensity on the same tasks.

The logical consequence of this view is to recommend that an external authority—\"the\" government—take over the commons. But considerable empirical evidence from field and experimental settings holds that appropriators frequently do constitute and enforce their own rules, and that these rules work. Our research agenda is to develop a coherent understanding of the set of conditions that enhance or detract from self-organizing capabilities when individuals differ substantially from one another. For the sake of concreteness, this paper focuses on the asymmetry present in most irrigation systems between those who are physically near the source of water (the head-enders) and those who are physically distant from it (the tail-enders). This paper first explores the interaction between head-end and tail-end farmers, particularly their decisions about whether to devote resources to the upkeep of the irrigation system, and how bargaining between the parties can benefit all sides.

  {"id":"Peic2021","abstract":"Recent research suggests that civilian defense forces (CDFs) – a distinct type of pro-government militia – can help states suppress insurgent movements. Considering the potential benefits, it is understandable why governments would want to use them. However, viewed from the perspective of civilian recruits, militia duty is a perilous side job that pays very little. So, why do civilians sign up to serve in them? This paper argues that civilian private agendas play a major role in facilitating the recruitment of CDFs. Because private agendas are difficult to observe directly, I examine their impact indirectly by identifying tribal groups as a population segment with particularly strong private incentives stemming from intertribal feuds and the concomitant desire to gain an upper hand relative to local rivals. The argument is tested on a novel provincelevel data set of CDF deployments in Turkey and the Philippines. Statistical analyses of these data show that states recruit over 50 percent more CDFs in regions with even modest tribal presence than in comparable areas without any tribal populations. These findings suggest that private agendas play a significant role in motivating militia recruitment. Private agendas thus help governments to combat macro-level insurgent movements by exploiting micro-level social tensions. The research also sheds light on the makeup of recruits and points to intensification of civilian disputes as likely ramification of CDF deployment in counterinsurgency campaigns.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,4,21]]},"author":[{"family":"Peic","given":"Goran"}],"citation-key":"Peic2021","container-title":"Studies in Conflict & Terrorism","container-title-short":"Studies in Conflict & Terrorism","DOI":"10.1080/1057610X.2019.1620432","ISSN":"1057-610X, 1521-0731","issue":"12","issued":{"date-parts":[[2021,12,2]]},"language":"en","page":"1022-1049","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Divide and Co-Opt: Private Agendas, Tribal Groups, and Militia Formation in Counterinsurgency Wars","title-short":"Divide and Co-Opt","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/1057610X.2019.1620432","volume":"44"},

  {"id":"Pokalova2019","abstract":"With the rise of the self-proclaimed Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS), the phenomenon of foreign ﬁghters became a signiﬁcant security concern. Governments around the world have become preoccupied with the possibility of their citizens leaving for combat zones and then coming back with training and experience. While previously foreign ﬁghters participated in such conﬂicts as Afghanistan, Bosnia, or Chechnya, today ISIS has attracted record numbers of individuals from various backgrounds. This article examines factors that might be connected with the outﬂow of foreign ﬁghters to Syria and Iraq. The analysis is based on 190 countries with 103 of them serving as countries of origin for 33,815 foreign ﬁghters. Negative binomial regression is used to evaluate the connection of political, economic, demographic, and social factors to numbers of foreign ﬁghters. The ﬁndings indicate that more foreign ﬁghters come from countries with higher Human Development Index levels, unemployment rates, percentages of youth, population size, percentages of Muslim population, emigration levels, Internet penetration, and the presence of Al Qaeda cells. However, the ﬁndings further indicate that the effect of these variables is not uniform across majority Muslim and majority non-Muslim countries.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,9,10]]},"author":[{"family":"Pokalova","given":"Elena"}],"citation-key":"Pokalova2019","container-title":"Studies in Conflict & Terrorism","container-title-short":"Studies in Conflict & Terrorism","DOI":"10.1080/1057610X.2018.1427842","ISSN":"1057-610X, 1521-0731","issue":"9","issued":{"date-parts":[[2019,9,2]]},"language":"en","page":"798-818","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Driving Factors behind Foreign Fighters in Syria and Iraq","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/1057610X.2018.1427842","volume":"42"},

  {"id":"Prishchepov.etal2021","abstract":"One of the recent phenomena in land-change history in the steppe belt of Russia after 1990 is the formation of unclaimed or partially claimed agricultural lands, their periodic and fragmented use, suggesting the change of land-use regimes compared to intensive cropping in the Soviet period (pre 1991). Therefore, there is a strong need for the systematic field and remotely-sensed monitoring of shifts of land-use regimes, because they may impact various socio-ecological processes, such as the spread of wildfires, degradation and recovery of vegetation on spared agricultural lands. Here we present an elaboration on monitoring with satellite observations and field surveys of land-cover dynamic in the steppe belt of Orenburg Province and with more detailed focus on the districts (rayons) of Orenburg Province, which were once a part of Virgin Lands Campaign (1954-1963), when croplands expanded at the expense of agro-environmental frontiers. Our remote-sensing observations and ground surveys revealed widespread abandonment from 1990 to 2018. The calculation of Shannon’s Diversity Index confirmed the change in the typology of land-use regimes in Orenburg Province transition from stable cultivation back to 1990 to new land regimes, such as stable cultivated areas with minor abandonment (typology #1) - e.g., Asekeevskij district; complete cropland contraction without recultivation (typology#2) - e.g., Akbulakskij district; strong fluctuation of cultivated and abandoned croplands from year to year (typology #3) - e.g., Pervomajskij district. Former Virgin Lands Campain areas were more exposed to typology #3. Shannon’s diversity index was useful to evaluate the changing land regimes and areas prone to socioeconomic and environmental shocks. We hypothesize a new stage of land regimes may provide opportunities for biodiversity conservation, but also threats such as the spread of wildfires, particularly under the projection of an increase of aridity.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,5,9]]},"author":[{"family":"Prishchepov","given":"Alexander V"},{"family":"Yakovlev","given":"Ilya"},{"family":"Myachina","given":"Ksenia"}],"citation-key":"Prishchepov.etal2021","container-title":"IOP Conference Series: Earth and Environmental Science","container-title-short":"IOP Conf.

This is in step with increases in domestic political competition and regime fragmentation across developing states. Using a new PGM dataset that collects discrete events perpetrated by these groups across Africa from 1997–2016, two conclusions are reached: PGM groups are more active outside of civil war periods than within, and their actions and numbers have increased as more countries transition to democracy. Further, activity by PGMs is not well explained by government attempts to delegate violence for reputational reasons or low capacity. Political fragmentation at the national level and diﬀuse opposition threats better account for the spatial and temporal patterns of PGM activity.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,4,21]]},"author":[{"family":"Raleigh","given":"Clionadh"},{"family":"Kishi","given":"Roudabeh"}],"citation-key":"Raleigh.Kishi2020","container-title":"Terrorism and Political Violence","container-title-short":"Terrorism and Political Violence","DOI":"10.1080/09546553.2017.1388793","ISSN":"0954-6553, 1556-1836","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[[2020,4,2]]},"language":"en","page":"582-603","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Hired Guns: Using Pro-Government Militias for Political Competition","title-short":"Hired Guns","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/09546553.2017.1388793","volume":"32"},

By focusing on the kinetic domain of hybrid warfare, the article offers a corrective to a debate that has so far ignored variation in roles and functions of non-state actors and their relationships with states and their regular forces. As a denominator, ‘hybrid’ identifies a combination of battlespaces, types of operations—military or non-kinetic—and a blurring of actors with the scope of achieving strategic objectives by creating exploitable ambiguity. However, there has been a disproportionate focus on what hybrid war supposedly combines across battlespaces and domains (socio-political, economic, informational), at the expense of who and how. Using the Ukrainian crisis as a theory-building exercise, the article suggests a four-category schema that identifies non-state actor functions as a tool to better represent the complex franchise of violence that is found nested next to non-military operations in hybrid activity. In so doing, the article speaks to a call for better conceptualization the role of non-state violent actors in civil war, in general, and in hybrid warfare, in particular.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,9,9]]},"author":[{"family":"Rauta","given":"Vladimir"}],"citation-key":"Rauta2020","container-title":"Cambridge Review of International Affairs","container-title-short":"Cambridge Review of International Affairs","DOI":"10.1080/09557571.2019.1656600","ISSN":"0955-7571, 1474-449X","issue":"6","issued":{"date-parts":[[2020,11,1]]},"language":"en","page":"868-887","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Towards a typology of non-state actors in ‘hybrid warfare’: proxy, auxiliary, surrogate and affiliated forces","title-short":"Towards a typology of non-state actors in ‘hybrid warfare’","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/09557571.2019.1656600","volume":"33"},

We ﬁrst discuss methods that exploit spatial structure to account for unmeasured confounding variables. We then discuss causal analysis in the presence of spatial interference including several common assumptions used to reduce the complexity of the interference patterns under consideration. These methods are extended to the spatiotemporal case where we compare and contrast the potential outcomes framework with Granger causality and to geostatistical analyses involving spatial random ﬁelds of treatments and responses.

The negotiation process centres on the continuing transformation of a hybrid political order, involving ‘formal’ as well as ‘informal’ spheres, both in existing institutions (as ‘rules of the game’) and in the bodies or agents enforcing these rules. The negotiation processes considered take place at the national and local level respectively, as well as between the two. These negotiations are heterogeneous, non-linear and ongoing. The article demonstrates how the polity’s tolerance for heterogeneous negotiations and different forms of statehood allowed local political actors to establish peace in their own local settings ﬁrst. Although it did not produce uniform statehood, it provided the basis for communities to explore the scope for common statehood. On the national level, hybrid elements initially allowed for a healthy adaptation of statehood to local needs, and for legitimate, productive instruments of negotiation. This responsiveness was not maintained, and current hybrid elements threaten to undermine the polity’s stability.","author":[{"family":"Renders","given":"Marleen"},{"family":"Terlinden","given":"Ulf"}],"citation-key":"Renders.Terlinden","language":"en","page":"25","source":"Zotero","title":"Negotiating Statehood in a Hybrid Political Order: The Case of Somaliland","type":"article-journal"},

Our method achieves accuracy competitive with deep neural networks at orders of magnitude lower computational cost, scales globally, delivers label super-resolution predictions, and facilitates characterizations of uncertainty. Since image encodings are shared across tasks, they can be centrally computed and distributed to unlimited researchers, who need only fit a linear regression to their own ground truth data in order to achieve state-of-the-art SIML performance.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,5,9]]},"author":[{"family":"Rolf","given":"Esther"},{"family":"Proctor","given":"Jonathan"},{"family":"Carleton","given":"Tamma"},{"family":"Bolliger","given":"Ian"},{"family":"Shankar","given":"Vaishaal"},{"family":"Ishihara","given":"Miyabi"},{"family":"Recht","given":"Benjamin"},{"family":"Hsiang","given":"Solomon"}],"citation-key":"Rolf.etal2021","container-title":"Nature Communications","container-title-short":"Nat Commun","DOI":"10.1038/s41467-021-24638-z","ISSN":"2041-1723","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2021,12]]},"language":"en","page":"4392","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"A generalizable and accessible approach to machine learning with global satellite imagery","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-021-24638-z","volume":"12"},

To move the debate on non-state armed groups (NSAGs) forward, this article seeks to enhance our conceptual understanding of parochial armed groups which are not primarily driven by ideological or religious objectives. Thus, this article clariﬁes similarities as well as differences between subtypes of community-based armed groups (CBAGs) on the one hand, and between CBAGs and other NSAGs, on the other hand. By doing so, a typology is developed that classiﬁes militias, gangs and vigilantes on the basis of their political, economic and security-related dimensions. The resulting ideal types are discussed through the lenses of different explanatory frameworks and policy debates in the ﬁeld of contemporary security studies. A major typological issue is the tendency for CBAGs to ‘turn bad’ and become threats to the stability they were expected to transform, becoming a serious problem in countries where they operate. It is concluded that the challenge of CBAGs ultimately needs to be addressed by putting in place a functioning state that can tackle the underlying woes that led to their proliferation in the ﬁrst place.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,4,21]]},"author":[{"family":"Schuberth","given":"Moritz"}],"citation-key":"Schuberth2015","container-title":"Contemporary Security Policy","container-title-short":"Contemporary Security Policy","DOI":"10.1080/13523260.2015.1061756","ISSN":"1352-3260, 1743-8764","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[[2015,5,4]]},"language":"en","page":"296-320","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"The Challenge of Community-Based Armed Groups: Towards a Conceptualization of Militias, Gangs, and Vigilantes","title-short":"The Challenge of Community-Based Armed Groups","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/13523260.2015.1061756","volume":"36"},

However, weather data are derived from stations operated by national governments, whose political capacity and stability affect the quality and continuity of coverage. We show that civil conflict risk in sub-Saharan Africa is negatively correlated with the number and density of weather stations contributing to a country’s temperature record. This effect is both cross-sectional—countries with higher average conflict risk tend to have poorer coverage—and cross-temporal—civil conflict leads to loss of weather stations. Poor coverage induces a small downward bias in one widely used temperature data set, due to its interpolation method, and increases measurement error, potentially attenuating estimates of the temperature–conflict relationship. Combining multiple observational data sets to reduce measurement error almost doubles the estimated effect of temperature anomalies on civil conflict risk.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,6,15]]},"author":[{"family":"Schultz","given":"Kenneth A."},{"family":"Mankin","given":"Justin S."}],"citation-key":"Schultz.Mankin2019","container-title":"American Journal of Political Science","container-title-short":"American Journal of Political Science","DOI":"10.1111/ajps.12425","ISSN":"0092-5853, 1540-5907","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[[2019,10]]},"language":"en","page":"723-739","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Is Temperature Exogenous?

Comparative evidence from India and Pakistan shows that varying regime ideological projects contribute to different patterns of militia–state relations.

  {"id":"Thai.etal2014","abstract":"Bootstrap methods are used in many disciplines to estimate the uncertainty of parameters, including multi-level or linear mixed-effects models. Residual-based bootstrap methods which resample both random effects and residuals are an alternative approach to case bootstrap, which resamples the individuals. Most PKPD applications use the case bootstrap, for which software is available. In this study, we evaluated the performance of three bootstrap methods (case bootstrap, nonparametric residual bootstrap and parametric bootstrap) by a simulation study and compared them to that of an asymptotic method in estimating uncertainty of parameters in nonlinear mixed-effects models (NLMEM) with heteroscedastic error. This simulation was conducted using as an example of the PK model for aﬂibercept, an anti-angiogenic drug. As expected, we found that the bootstrap methods provided better estimates of uncertainty for parameters in NLMEM with high nonlinearity and having balanced designs compared to the asymptotic method, as implemented in MONOLIX. Overall, the parametric bootstrap performed better than the case bootstrap as the true model and variance distribution were used. However, the case bootstrap is faster and simpler as it makes no assumptions on the model and preserves both between subject and residual variability in one resampling step. The performance of the nonparametric residual bootstrap was found to be limited when applying to NLMEM due to its failure to reﬂate the variance before resampling in unbalanced designs where the asymptotic method and the parametric bootstrap performed well and better than case bootstrap even with stratiﬁcation.","author":[{"family":"Thai","given":"Hoai-Thu"},{"family":"Mentré","given":"France"},{"family":"Holford","given":"Nick"},{"family":"Veyrat-Follet","given":"Christine"},{"family":"Comets","given":"Emmanuelle"}],"citation-key":"Thai.etal2014","issued":{"date-parts":[[2014]]},"language":"en","page":"30","source":"Zotero","title":"Evaluation of bootstrap methods for estimating uncertainty of parameters in nonlinear mixed-effects models: a simulation study in population pharmacokinetics","type":"article-journal","volume":"2014"},

We develop an explanation for the endurance of traditional authorities, based on extensive fieldwork in one recently developed neighbourhood in a previously uninhabited part of Greater Accra, where we conducted interviews and analysed documents from the archives of the chief’s Divisional Council. We show that the formation of a modern state has restricted the chiefs’ discretion as sovereigns but afforded them greater power as managers of the land and gatekeepers of the state bureaucracy.

This article presents a standardized structure for storing, manipulating, and analyzing high-resolution spatial data. PRIO-GRID is a vector grid network with a resolution of 0.5 x 0.5 decimal degrees, covering all terrestrial areas of the world. Gridded data comprise inherently apolitical entities; the grid cells are fixed in time and space, they are insensitive to political boundaries and developments, and they are completely exogenous to likely features of interest, such as civil war outbreak, ethnic settlement patterns, extreme weather events, or the spatial distribution of wealth. Moreover, unlike other disaggregated approaches, gridded data may be scaled up or down in a consistent manner by varying the resolution of the grid. The released dataset comes with cell-specific information on a large selection of political, economic, demographic, environmental, and conflict variables for all years, 1946–2008. A simple descriptive data assessment of population density and economic activity is offered to demonstrate how PRIO-GRID may be applied in quantitative social science research.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,6,11]]},"author":[{"family":"Tollefsen","given":"Andreas Forø"},{"family":"Strand","given":"Håvard"},{"family":"Buhaug","given":"Halvard"}],"citation-key":"Tollefsen.etal2012","container-title":"Journal of Peace Research","container-title-short":"Journal of Peace Research","DOI":"10.1177/0022343311431287","ISSN":"0022-3433, 1460-3578","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[[2012,3]]},"language":"en","page":"363-374","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"PRIO-GRID: A unified spatial data structure","title-short":"PRIO-GRID","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0022343311431287","volume":"49"},

  {"id":"vanBaalen2021","abstract":"Why is rebel governance more responsive in some areas than in others? In recent years, scholars have started to examine the determinants of rebel governance. Less attention has been given to explaining variation in the responsiveness of rebel governance, that is, the degree to which rebels are soliciting and acting upon civilian preferences in their governance. This article seeks to address this gap by studying local variation in rebel responsiveness. I argue that rebel responsiveness is a function of whether local elites control clientelist networks that allow them to mobilize local citizens. Strong clientelist networks are characterized by local elite control over resources and embeddedness in local authority structures. In turn, such networks shape local elites’ capacity for mobilizing support for, or civil resistance against, the rebels, and hence their bargaining power in negotiations over rebel governance. Drawing on unique interview and archival data collected during eight months of fieldwork, as well as existing survey data, the study tests the argument through a systematic comparison of four areas held by the Forces Nouvelles in Coˆte d’Ivoire. The analysis indicates that the strength of local elites’ clientelist networks shapes rebel responsiveness. Moreover, it provides support for the theorized civil resistance mechanism, and shows that this mechanism is further enhanced by ethnopolitical ties between civilians and rebels. These findings speak to the burgeoning literature on rebel governance and to research on civil resistance. In addition, the results inform policy debates on how to protect civilians in civil war.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,4,21]]},"author":[{"family":"Baalen","given":"Sebastian","non-dropping-particle":"van"}],"citation-key":"vanBaalen2021","container-title":"Journal of Peace Research","container-title-short":"Journal of Peace Research","DOI":"10.1177/0022343320965675","ISSN":"0022-3433, 1460-3578","issue":"5","issued":{"date-parts":[[2021,9]]},"language":"en","page":"930-944","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Local elites, civil resistance, and the responsiveness of rebel governance in Côte d’Ivoire","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0022343320965675","volume":"58"},

Multitemporal satellite remote sensing is well suited for monitoring urban conflict damage patterns, providing unique and actionable insights for protecting civilians, guiding humanitarian response and relief, and identifying affected infrastructure throughout a conflict. However, satellite image time series monitoring of urban conflict damage has struggled to offer substantive information beyond what is already known from georeferenced conflict event databases and results of bi-temporal (before/after) satellite image change detection. Current shortcomings can be addressed by better recognizing the spatial and temporal linkages between conflict processes, urban morphology, and the pathways for damage expression and detection across the urban fabric. In this chapter, scholarship on remote sensing of urban conflict damage is synthesized, linkages between urban conflict processes and urban damage patterns are discussed, and a theory of change to guide multitemporal satellite-based monitoring of urban conflict is proposed. Recognizing the various pathways that violent urban conflict manifests as damage and the means by which damage can be detected using multitemporal satellite data pave the way for heightened understanding of vulnerability as well as resilience of urban populations and infrastructure ­during wartime.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,5,9]]},"author":[{"family":"Van Den Hoek","given":"Jamon"}],"citation-key":"VanDenHoek2021","container-title":"Urban Remote Sensing","DOI":"10.1002/9781119625865.ch15","edition":"1","editor":[{"family":"Yang","given":"Xiaojun"}],"ISBN":"978-1-119-62584-1 978-1-119-62586-5","issued":{"date-parts":[[2021,9,30]]},"language":"en","page":"325-333","publisher":"Wiley","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"The City is the Medium and Satellite Imagery Are a Prism: Conceptualizing Urban Conflict Damage Monitoring with Multitemporal Remote Sensing Data","title-short":"The City is the Medium and Satellite Imagery Are a Prism","type":"chapter","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/9781119625865.ch15"},

  {"id":"Wang.etal2021","abstract":"Villages closer to urban centers often have higher economic growth, better agricultural conditions and better welfare outcomes. However, few studies have linked villages’ proximity to urban centers with governance of the commons. In this paper, we explore the effects of urban proximity on the irrigation commons using ordered probit models, stepwise regression and the Sobel-Goodman mediation test, with survey data from 1257 villages in 306 counties and 27 provinces across China. We ﬁnd that villages’ proximity to provincial economic centers has a direct and positive effect on collective action in the irrigation commons, which could be attributed to farmers’ incentives for agricultural intensiﬁcation. Agriculture in villages closer to market centers is more commercially oriented, which gives farmers incentives to participate in collective action to reap the beneﬁts of maintaining the irrigation commons. We also ﬁnd that proximity between the village and the provincial economic center increases irrigation collective action through the mediated effects of village topography, population and collective income. The results enrich the literature of commons study and imply that distance to the economic center should be considered in policy making for rural revitalization and implementation of the New Urban Agenda as well as the Sustainable Development Goals.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,5,4]]},"author":[{"family":"Wang","given":"Yahua"},{"family":"Chen","given":"Sicheng"},{"family":"Araral","given":"Eduardo"}],"citation-key":"Wang.etal2021","container-title":"World Development","container-title-short":"World Development","DOI":"10.1016/j.worlddev.2021.105444","ISSN":"0305750X","issued":{"date-parts":[[2021,6]]},"language":"en","page":"105444","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"The mediated effects of urban proximity on collective action in the commons: Theory and evidence from China","title-short":"The mediated effects of urban proximity on collective action in the commons","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0305750X21000565","volume":"142"},

  {"id":"Wegenast.Beck2020","abstract":"The potential impacts of extractive industries on local food security are difﬁcult to predict. On the one hand, resource extraction may generate more employment opportunities, provide farmers with better market access and increase ﬁscal transfers to resource-producing regions. On the other hand, mineral production may contribute to the marginalization of poor smallholders by encouraging land grabs, environmental degradation and structural labor market shifts. Combining geocoded survey data from the Demographic Health Survey and Afrobarometer with information on the control rights of gold, diamond and copper mines in Sub-Saharan Africa, this paper is the ﬁrst attempt to systematically test the effect of mining activities on local populations’ access to food. Results from logistic models using individual mines as level of analysis suggest that the impact of mineral extraction on food security is gender- and ownership-speciﬁc. Mining operations decrease food availability among women in a substantial way, while – at the same time – showing no signiﬁcant or even a positive effect on men’s access to food. Our instrumental variable models further reveal that particularly multinational mining companies are linked to increased food insecurity, while domestic ﬁrms are not. Finally, our ﬁxed effects estimates demonstrate that mining is also related to poorer nutritional diversity. Relying on detailed information on children’s food consumption patterns from the Demographic Health Survey, we ﬁnd that children living in districts hosting multinational mining ﬁrms eat a less diverse diet compared to other districts.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,5,9]]},"author":[{"family":"Wegenast","given":"Tim"},{"family":"Beck","given":"Jule"}],"citation-key":"Wegenast.Beck2020","container-title":"World Development","container-title-short":"World Development","DOI":"10.1016/j.worlddev.2020.104921","ISSN":"0305750X","issued":{"date-parts":[[2020,6]]},"language":"en","page":"104921","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Mining, rural livelihoods and food security: A disaggregated analysis of sub-Saharan Africa","title-short":"Mining, rural livelihoods and food security","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0305750X20300474","volume":"130"},

In order to open the black box of the state, it is necessary to pinpoint the location of key conflict parties. As a contribution to this task, this article describes a data project that geo-references ethnic groups around the world. Relying on maps and data drawn from the classical Soviet Atlas Narodov Mira (ANM), the ‘Geo-referencing of ethnic groups’ (GREG) dataset employs geographic information systems (GIS) to represent group territories as polygons. This article introduces the structure of the GREG dataset and gives an example for its application by examining the impact of group concentration on conflict. In line with previous findings, the authors show that groups with a single territorial cluster according to GREG have a significantly higher risk of conflict. This example demonstrates how the GREG dataset can be processed in the R statistical package without specific skills in GIS. The authors also provide a detailed discussion of the shortcomings of the GREG dataset, resulting from the datedness of the ANM and its unclear coding conventions. In comparing GREG to other datasets on ethnicity, the article makes an attempt to illustrate the strengths and weaknesses associated with the GREG database.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,6,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Weidmann","given":"Nils B."},{"family":"Rød","given":"Jan Ketil"},{"family":"Cederman","given":"Lars-Erik"}],"citation-key":"Weidmann.etal2010","container-title":"Journal of Peace Research","container-title-short":"Journal of Peace Research","DOI":"10.1177/0022343310368352","ISSN":"0022-3433, 1460-3578","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[[2010,7]]},"language":"en","page":"491-499","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Representing ethnic groups in space: A new dataset","title-short":"Representing ethnic groups in space","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0022343310368352","volume":"47"},

In contrast to existing attempt-level data, the monadic panel design of the dataset captures not only actual attempts at peaceful resolution – the result of an agreement between disputants – but also proposals for methods that did not occur but were preferred at a particular time point. Our dataset allows for robust and generalizable quantitative analyses of the peaceful resolution of territorial disputes that are sensitive to temporal, regional, claim-based, and state-level trends. To demonstrate the utility of our dataset, we use hybrid logistic regression to examine the determinants of binding PRTD proposals.

  {"id":"Wiessner2020","abstract":"Significance\n            Cultural norms are key to cooperation but are challenging to uphold. Humans have deep-seated predispositions for regulating norms through both retributive and restorative means. The Enga of Papua New Guinea, a small-scale horticultural society, navigate the national judicial system of legal plurality—formal Western-style courts with retributive justice and customary courts with restorative justice. An analysis of 333 customary court cases shows that Enga choose restorative options to compensate the victim for losses, reintegrate the wrongdoer, and restore cooperation because cooperation and collective action are essential to survival in small-scale societies. Today, in many industrialized societies, efforts are made to reintegrate elements of such age-old restorative systems by respectful listening to both sides, apologies, amends, and reconciliation.\n          , \n            Cultural norms are key to cooperation in human societies. How they are regulated, maintained, and adapted to the change remains a matter of debate. Humans have dispositions for both retributive and restorative justice; recent focus has been on third-party punishment, punitive sanctions by those not directly harmed, as key for norm enforcement. However, punishment does not engage the essential proficiencies and emotions critical to cooperation in small-scale societies with high dependence on collective action, sharing, and exchange. Third-party participation in norm enforcement is examined with data from a 10-y study among the Enga of Papua New Guinea. The Enga have a plural justice system with formal courts practicing retributive justice and customary courts applying restorative measures. Most cases are brought to customary courts. Drawing on observations from 333 village customary court cases concerning assault, marriage, land, and property violations, third-party engagement outside of and during customary court hearings is analyzed. Results show that all sides are heard, restoration is prioritized, and third-party punishment is rare; rather, third parties help with compensation to reintegrate wrongdoers and resolve conflicts. Repeated offenders and free riders receive ever less community support. Third parties contribute substantially both during and outside of customary court sessions to help kin, pursue economic agendas, or gain reputation. They also act generously to build a strong community. Emphasis is on amends to the victim for fairness, not punishment of the offender. Broad third-party participation is maintained throughout times of rapid change to adapt while supporting essential structures of society.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,10,26]]},"author":[{"family":"Wiessner","given":"Polly"}],"citation-key":"Wiessner2020","container-title":"Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences","container-title-short":"Proc.

We argue that customary institutions can pacify through facilitating credible nonviolent bargaining. Studying 143 ethnic groups, we provide large-N evidence for such an ‘ethnic civil peace’, showing that groups with a higher number of formalized customary institutions, like houses of chiefs, courts and legislatures, are less prone to communal conflict, both internally and with other groups.

This equivalence furthers our understanding of the anatomy of TWFE, and has several applications. The equivalence between TWFE and TWM implies that various estimators used for intervention analysis – with a common entry time into treatment or staggered entry, with or without covariates – can be computed using TWFE or pooled OLS regressions that control for time-constant treatment intensities, covariates, and interactions between them. The approach allows considerable heterogeneity in treatment effects across treatment intensity, calendar time, and covariates. The equivalence implies that standard strategies for heterogeneous trends are available to relax the common trends assumption.

  {"id":"Zang.etal2021","abstract":"Farmland scale management represents an inevitable trend toward global modern agriculture. In the new development context, the key to solving the tough problem of the insufﬁcient supply of rural public goods is to effectively improve the enthusiasm of farming households to participate in rural collective action in countries with a small arable area per capita, such as India, China and countries in Eastern Europe. This paper adopts the Institutional Analysis and Development (IAD) framework in the context of a land system with Chinese characteristics, and uses sample data of 3663 rural households in 17 provinces to study the impact of farmland scale and various relevant systems on farming households’ participation in rural collective action. We found that the advantages of collective action, such as reduced production costs, enhanced risk resistance and improved production efﬁciency, can offset the disadvantages incurred by free-riding behavior, and the expansion of farmland scale can signiﬁcantly facilitate rural collective action. Additionally, as the farmland scale expands, stable farmland tenure and reasonable farmland tenure transfer can help to optimize the allocation of arable land resources, increase investment, and reduce free-riding behavior, thus effectively stimulating farming households to actively participate in collective action. However, since socialized agricultural services lead to the separation of the suppliers and the users of rural public goods, the expansion of farmland scale shows a negative effect. Therefore, in the context of the continuous migration of the rural population to cities, a stable farmland tenure adjustment mechanism should be established, while the balance between farmland tenure transfer and socialized agricultural services, in pushing forward rural collective action, should be emphasized, so as to ensure the effective supply of rural public goods in propelling farmland scale management. Especially in promoting the development of socialized agricultural services, more attention should be paid to specifying the responsibilities and obligations of the main provider of commercialized services in the supply of rural public goods.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,5,7]]},"author":[{"family":"Zang","given":"Liangzhen"},{"family":"Wang","given":"Yahua"},{"family":"Su","given":"Yiqing"}],"citation-key":"Zang.etal2021","container-title":"Land","container-title-short":"Land","DOI":"10.3390/land10111263","ISSN":"2073-445X","issue":"11","issued":{"date-parts":[[2021,11,19]]},"language":"en","page":"1263","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Does Farmland Scale Management Promote Rural Collective Action?

  {"id":"Zhirnov.etal2022","abstract":"In recent decades, political science literature has experienced significant growth in the popularity of nonlinear models with multiplicative interaction terms. When one or more constitutive variables are not binary, most studies report the marginal effect of the variable of interest at its sample mean while allowing the other constitutive variable/s to vary along its range and holding all other covariates constant at their means, modes, or medians. In this article, we argue that this conventional approach is not always the most suitable since the marginal effect of a variable at its sample mean might not be sufficiently representative of its prevalent effect at a specific value of the conditioning variable and might produce excessively model-dependent predictions. We propose two procedures to help researchers gain a better understanding of how the typical effect of the variable of interest varies as a function of the conditioning variable: (1) computing and plotting the marginal effects at all in-sample combinations of the values of the constitutive variables and (2) computing and plotting what we call the “Distribution-Weighted Average Marginal Effect” over the values of the conditioning variable.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,9,10]]},"author":[{"family":"Zhirnov","given":"Andrei"},{"family":"Moral","given":"Mert"},{"family":"Sedashov","given":"Evgeny"}],"citation-key":"Zhirnov.etal2022","container-title":"Political Analysis","container-title-short":"Polit.
