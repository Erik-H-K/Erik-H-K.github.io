        "# No such thing as an ungoverned space - An introduction\n",
        "The state is often defined by its monopoly on legitimate violence and control over a defined territory [@Weber1926]. Fragile or collapsed states, unable to meet these criteria, are commonly seen as chaotic and insecure, where life becomes \"nasty, brutish, and short\" [@Hobbes2017]. This view dominates both academic and policy discussions, especially concerning regions like the Sahel, where many see widespread anarchy [@Glawion2020; @Fukuyama2004; @OECD2020].\n",
        "\n",
        "However, the reality is more nuanced. While central governments in fragile states may be weak, various non-state actors—including traditional authorities, rebel groups, and vigilante organizations — often step in to govern and provide security [@Zartman1995; @Boege.etal2009]. This phenomenon is known as \"hybrid order,\" where state authority is shared, not entirely absent [@Risse-Kappen2011; @Glawion2020].\n",
        "\n",
        "This analysis explores how civilians in these hybrid orders respond to insecurity, focusing on the rise of vigilante groups. These groups, composed of ordinary citizens, take on security roles in the absence of effective state or rebel forces [@Schuberth2015; @Frowd2022]. This is an interesting phenomenon, because, rather than fleeing or joining armed factions in a conflict, these communities instead chooses to mobilize, in order, to protect themselves.\n",
        "\n",
        "Using data on vigilante activity across Africa from 2000 to 2016, this analysis will try to understand what drives their formation. Consequently, this analysis diverges firstly from the conventional view of fragile states as purely anarchic, and secondly highlights how local populations are not only passive bystanders in violent conflicts, but actually possesses agency when trying to create order and security in otherwise ungoverned spaces [@Osorio.etal2021; @Jentzsch2022].\n",
        "\n",
        "# Whom and why? \n",
        "I will in this section outline what I mean by vigilante groups. Moreover, drawing on theories of mobilization and of the security environment, I will deduce predictions of why vigilante groups appear and their level of activity. Predictions that subsequently will guide me on the design of my statistical model. \n",
        "\n",
        "## Vigilante groups as community based actors\n",
        "Conflicts are normally viewed through the bipolar framework of governments on one side and rebels on the other. However, if we enlarge the number of distinct actors in this theatre of violence our ability to grasp violent conflicts will increase. I will begin by considering the overarching category of *non-state actors*, which include rebels, private military companies (PMC), and Community-Based Armed Groups (CBAG). CBAGs distinguishes themselves from the two former actor categories by 1) not seeking independence from a government or colonial power, 2) aims to protect the status quo or property rather than capturing the state or pursuing a revolutionary agenda [@Schuberth2015: 299; @Peic2021: 1022; @Jentzsch2022: 14], which is the case of rebels, and 3) have informal relationships with sponsors, unlike PMCs, which operate under formal legal contracts [@Schuberth2015: 298]. \n",
        "We can further subdivide CBAGs into the following three categories: vigilante groups, militias, and gangs. Vigilante groups are primarily concerned with local security. They are often formed by local citizens to defend their communities from threats, both internal and external. These groups are typically organized from the bottom-up and operate at the village level [@Schuberth2015: 300; @Jentzsch2022: 16; @Barter2013: 79-80; @IbrahimShire2022: 4-5]. Vigilante groups may also be referred to as anti-crime groups or civilian self-defense forces [@Schuberth2015: 301-303; @Peic2021: 1022]. Militias, on the other hand, are driven by political goals. They form a patron-client relationship with political or ethnic leaders, who provide incentives in exchange for using violence against rivals. Militias are usually mobilized from the top-down, with members motivated by political or ethnic ties [@Dearing2021; @Reno2007: 102; @Schuberth2015: 305]. Lastly, gangs, such as drug cartels, are primarily economically motivated [@Schuberth2015: 308].\n",

Picture by Raffaele Ciriello](pictures/kama.jpg)\n",
        "\n",
        "## The emergence of vigilante groups\n",
        "### State accessibility\n",
        "Vigilante groups form in response to security needs where the state fails to provide adequate protection. Civilians mobilize vigilante groups when insecurity rises in regions where the state lacks control or cannot monopolize violence [@Chojnacki.Branovic2011: 95]. \n",
        "In some cases, state fragility leads to an absence of security, encouraging civilians to take action. Vigilante groups emerge in areas with limited state presence, while militias are more likely to form where the state has a strong military foothold [@Barter2013; @Peic2021]. This trend is observed in places like Latin America, Asia, and the Middle East, where vigilante groups appear in ungoverned spaces [@Arjona.Kalyvas2009].\n",
        "Thus we can expect that the activity level of vigilante groups are closely linked to the state's ability to access and control a region [@Muller-Crepon.etal2021].\n",
        "\n",
        "### A hostile security environment\n",
        "The nature of the security environment plays a key role in vigilante group mobilization. Scholars have highlighted how the balance of power between state and rebel forces, as well as the tactics they use, can drive civilians to form vigilante groups. In Mozambique, military stalemates and lack of security guarantees led to the rise of such groups [@Jentzsch2022: 175]. Similarly, in Indonesia, repeated rebel attacks against specific ethnic groups sparked vigilante activity [@Barter2013: 89].\n",
        "\n",
        "Vigilante groups can also emerge in non-civil war environments. For example, in Nigeria and Mexico, groups like the Bakassi Boys were formed in response to criminal gangs [@Meagher2012; @Osorio.etal2021]. In other cases, vigilante groups have mobilized to counter rival ethnic groups [@Thomson2019; @Peic2021].\n",
        "\n",
        "The common theme is that civilians mobilize vigilante groups in response to perceived threats. To better understand this, we can apply Zech's concept of the \"balance of threat,\" inspired by structural realism in international relations [@Zech2016: 31]. Just as states balance against perceived threats to their survival, civilian communities may do the same when faced with local threats. According to Walt's theory, threat perception depends on factors like power, proximity, offensive capabilities, and intentions [@Walt1985: 8-9].\n",
        "\n",
        "Thus, when civilians face hostile actors or uncertain environments, their demand for security increases, and vigilante mobilization follows. This pattern is seen in cases like South Sudan, where the South Sudan Defense Force formed to counter the rebel Sudanese People's Liberation Army [@Arnold2007], and in Colombia, where civilians formed self-defense groups to protect their communities [@Nussio2011].\n",
        "\n",
        "### Having the ability to mobilize - how strong communities help mobilize vigilante groups\n",
        "\n",
        "Explanations focused on a lack of state security and a hostile security environment describe how civilians, due to a lack of security guarantees, are forced to provide for their own safety in a market without a formal security monopolist. However, it would be naive to assume that vigilante group formation is an automatic response to insecurity, as seen in the case of refugees fleeing conflict zones rather than forming vigilante groups. For example, during the second civil war in Southern Sudan, despite attacks from the Sudan People's Liberation Army on government-free villages, only a few organized vigilante groups for protection [@Blocq2014: 716]. A similar pattern was observed in the Peruvian civil war [@Zech2016].\n",
        "\n",
        "This suggests that the willingness of civilians to form vigilante groups in response to insecurity is influenced by other factors. From a rational choice perspective, one such factor is the need to overcome the collective action problem, given that mobilizing vigilante groups is a collective effort [@Osorio.etal2021: 1568]. According to rational choice theory, agents will only participate if the expected benefits outweigh the costs [@Olson1968]. Vigilante participation often offers little individual benefit, especially when compared to the risks and effort involved, such as economic costs, exposure to violence, and the lack of protected accommodation [@Arjona.Kalyvas2009; @Peic2021]. Moreover, the uncertainty of how many others will join further discourages participation, as a smaller group increases personal risk [@Lohmann1994: 59; @Chenoweth.Stephan2011: 39-40].\n",
        "\n",
        "Another challenge is that the security provided by vigilante groups is a public good, meaning all benefit from it whether they participate or not. This incentivizes free-riding, as individuals can avoid the risk of harm while still receiving protection [@Olson1968; @Mason2004: 4-6]. As Magagna aptly notes, “joining a vigilante group is a dangerous deed, and many would prefer to free-ride if they cannot predict they will not be killed in the process” [@Magagna2019: 46].\n",
        "\n",
        "However, social structures within communities can alter this cost-benefit analysis, making collective action more likely [@Lichbach1995; @Putnam.etal1993; @Fukuyama2001; @Ostrom.Ahn2007; @Oliver1993; @Granovetter1973]. Research shows that pro-government vigilante groups often emerge from traditional tribal communities, which use vigilante membership to pursue private agendas like inter-tribal feuds or defend their autonomy from outside intervention [@Thomson2019; @Peic2021: 1027-1029; @Magagna2019: 36]. These communities may mobilize vigilante groups more easily because of pre-existing social structures that facilitate collective action [@Humphreys.Weinstein2008: 451; @Forney2015: 830; @Hoffman2007: 642; @Zech2016: 191; @Jentzsch2022; @Blocq2014; @Menkhaus2007].\n",
        "\n",
        "These examples show that for vigilante groups to form, agents must be embedded in social structures that reshape their cost-benefit analysis, making participation more likely. However, the precise causal mechanisms linking social structures to vigilante group formation remain varied and inconsistent across cases.\n",
        "\n",
        "Based on Lichbach’s extensive review of collective action in rebel groups, this study adopts the concept of community as the unit of social structure. Lichbach defines communities as those characterized by strong social institutions, shared beliefs, and collective behavior [@Lichbach1995: 111]. To further understand how community attributes help overcome the collective action problem, this study applies the Institutional Analysis and Development (IAD) framework developed by Ostrom and colleagues [@Ostrom.etal1994]. Given the bottom-up nature of vigilante groups, the IAD framework offers a suitable model for understanding the mechanisms behind their emergence. The framework identifies three components: \n",
        "\n",
        "1)  *Attributes of Community*: The structure of the more general community that the arena is situated in.\n",
        "2)  *Rules*: Formal and informal rules used by participants as prescriptions of the kind of behaviour that are required, prohibited, and permitted.\n",
        "3)  *Biophysical/Material Conditions*: The attributes of the biophysical/material condition that the actors act upon [@Ostrom2006: 15; @McGinnis2011: 172].\n",
        "\n",
        "Using the three factors as a framework for theorising which attributes of a community affect the action situation in such a way that it facilitates collective action, and together with literature relating to the subject of collective action, the study will go through each factor and describe the mechanisms linking the individual factor and collective action.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Attributes of Community: \n",
        "For successful vigilante mobilization, an organizational focal point is necessary. Granovetter's theory suggests that the nature of social networks plays a key role: strong ties form isolated cliques, while weak ties connect more agents and facilitate broader information flow, reducing the transaction costs of obtaining critical information [@Granovetter1973; @Ostrom2015: 190, 194]. In collective action, information on others' participation is crucial as it helps agents evaluate risks and costs associated with violent actions [@Lohmann1994; @Oliver1993]. Additionally, shared norms can create expectations for collective action, where non-participation may result in community sanctions, such as restricted access to common resources [@Ostrom2015: 194; @Mason2004: 17].\n",
        "\n",
        "Marwell et al.'s simulations indicate that weak ties centralizing around an organizational focal point significantly influence collective action [@Marwell.etal1988]. Social institutions, such as governing councils or neighborhoods, can also act as mobilizing structures, driving collective engagement [@Mason2004].\n",
        "\n",
        "A second mechanism is the existence of pre-established cooperative arrangements. Communities that engage in cooperative agricultural production, for instance, often exhibit stronger norms of cooperation and reciprocity [@Henrich.etal2001]. This link between productive cooperation and collective action is observed in various studies on agricultural practices in Brazil and China [@Gneezy.etal2016; @Talhelm.etal2014]. Communities that treat land as a common good tend to mobilize protests and collective action more effectively than those with private property systems [@Katz2000; @Trasberg2021; @Mearns1996; @Boone2014].\n",
        "\n",
        "These arrangements foster long-term commitments, reciprocity, and visibility of non-participation, increasing the likelihood of collective security efforts and providing enforcement mechanisms for noncompliance [@Axelrod2006; @Zech2016; @Tsai2007].\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Rules\n",
        "To understand how rules influence vigilante group mobilization, it's essential to examine whether existing institutions provide formal arrangements that shape agents' incentives. Rules, both formal and informal, dictate which actions are required, prohibited, or permitted, shaping the action situation [@Ostrom2006: 17-18; @Ostrom2015: 51].\n",
        "\n",
        "Rules impose costs on specific actions, either material (e.g., monetary) or immaterial (e.g., loss of reputation), which can deter agents from rule-breaking due to future cooperation risks [@Ostrom2015: 98]. In collective action, rules help sustain cooperation by ensuring agents trust that their cooperation will be reciprocated and by fostering a general sense of reciprocity [@Lichbach1995: 129-134]. The effectiveness of rules depends on the presence of formal or informal institutions that enforce compliance [@Lichbach1995: 132; @Ostrom2006: 20].\n",
        "\n",
        "In some ethnic communities, customary law serves as the basis for internal decision-making and judicial processes [@Holzinger.etal2019; @Eck2014; @Wig.Kromrey2018]. A study in Uganda shows that in institutional settings with universal norms of reciprocity and third-party enforcement, individuals prone to free-riding are more likely to participate in collective action [@Habyarimana.etal2009]. Similarly, in China, larger clans in rural villages enhance cooperation through informal enforcement of reciprocity [@Xu.Yao2015]. Studies also highlight the positive impact of general enforcement rules on farmers' contributions to common pool resource maintenance [@Cao.etal2020; @Zang.etal2021].\n",
        "\n",
        "In conclusion, both formal and informal rules affect the ability of communities to mobilize vigilante groups by fostering reciprocity and influencing agents' cost-benefit analyses. A lack of participation in security provision may affect an agent's reputation, reducing future cooperation from others.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Biophysical/ Material Conditions\n",
        "Biophysical/Material Conditions\n",
        "\n",
        "The physical environment plays a crucial role in rural communities' ability to create and manage collective goods, as well as their potential for mobilizing violent collective action. There are two primary ways this characteristic impacts collective action.\n",
        "\n",
        "First, spatial features, such as population density, influence social networks. Densely populated areas foster more frequent interactions, improving opportunities for collective action [@Weidmann2009: 538]. In contrast, isolated communities, like French smallholder peasants, tend to be self-reliant, with small social networks centered on the family. This isolation hinders the development of class-based political organization and collective action, as observed in various countries [@Marx1852: 62; @Paige1975: 35; @Stinchcombe1961: 45-46].\n",
        "\n",
        "Second, the biophysical features of the land shape social interactions and agricultural production methods. For instance, Boserup's study of hoe versus plough cultivation found that cultivation methods influenced gender norms, with ploughing requiring more upper-body strength, giving men an advantage and leading to gender-specific roles [@Boserup1972]. This finding is supported by a large-N study on cultivation methods and gender norms [@Alesina.etal2013]. Similarly, norms of masculinity in America differed between pastoralists and agriculturalists, with the former developing a \"culture of honor\" that encouraged violent retaliation to uphold justice [@Cohen.etal1996; @Grosjean2014].\n",
        "\n",
        "Irrigation systems also play a key role in fostering cooperation. Wittfogel’s study on hydro societies shows that large-scale irrigation projects in arid regions required collective effort, leading to the development of centralized bureaucracies, as seen in ancient Egypt and Babylon [@Wittfogel1957: 18]. Ostrom’s research on common pool resources highlights how irrigation systems create norms of cooperation, as users develop complex institutions to manage resources sustainably [@Ostrom2015; @Ostrom.Gardner1993; @Lam.Ostrom2010].\n",
        "\n",
        "Irrigation systems not only demonstrate successful social mobilization but also serve as organizational focal points for social interaction. Studies show that communities relying on irrigation, such as rice farmers in China, have stronger norms of collectivism compared to wheat farmers, due to the higher labor and cooperation demands of rice cultivation [@Talhelm.etal2014]. Similarly, farmers in the Philippines involved in irrigation schemes display more cooperative behavior than those relying on rainfed techniques [@Tsusaka.etal2015; @Fujiie.etal2005]. In Pakistan and India, traditional irrigation systems are seen as essential to community structure and social interaction [@Mustafa.Qazi2007; @vonCarnap2017]. In conclusion, rural areas that depend on irrigation tend to develop strong norms of cooperation and extensive social networks, making them more capable of mobilizing vigilante groups.\n",
        "\n",
        "![The three dimensions facilitating collective action](figures/figure_8.png)\n",
        "\n",
        "# Data and operationalisation\n",
        "The empirical analysis is conducted using ethnic settlement areas as the spatial unit of analysis. The choice of ethnic groups is grounded in the fact that ethnic groups on the African function as an essential community identifier for individuals [@Ekeh1975: 107]. As a result, it allows the study to come closer to the actual social institutions that shape peoples' behavior, thereby more accurately gauge how communities condition vigilante mobilization.\\\n",
        "Data on ethnic settlement areas are provided by the Geo-referencing Ethnic Power Relations (GeoEPR hereafter) project, which collects information on the relationship between state power and politically relevant ethnic groups. The project defines ethnicity as: \"*any subjectively experienced sense of commonality based on the belief in common ancestry and shared culture*\", and accounts a group as being politically relevant if a significant political actor claims to represent it in the political arena or if the group is experiencing political discrimination.\\\n",
        "\n",
        "## The dependent variable: Vigilante activity \n",
        "Vigilante mobilization is measured using geo-referenced data on conflict events. Data is provided by The Armed Conflict Location & Event Data Project (ACLED), that is generated using news sources, expert and NGO reports on violent and non-violent conflict events worldwide, with a particular focus on Africa.\\\n",
        "Conflict events consist of a series of actions realized by one actor or between multiple actors. Contrary to similar data sets, there is not a fatality-based threshold for the inclusion of events, nor do they have to be part of pre-defined modes of organised violence. This approach allows the study to include a broader subset of actions carried out by vigilante groups [@Raleigh.etal2010].\\ Investigating vigilante group presence the analysis will use the ACLED defined actor categories of *communal militia* or an *identity militia* which is defined as: \"*organised around a collective, common feature including community, region, religion or, in exceptional cases, livelihood*\". Moreover, ACLED also categorises whether groups can be defined as *political militias*, thus it is ensured that our signal of the appearance of vigilante groups is not confused with that of militias as descirbed in section on CBAGs.\\\n",

        "![Vigilante activity across time and space on the African continent](figures/figure_3_heat_map.png)\n",
        "\n",
        "## Independent variables\n",
        "\n",
        "### State access\n",
        "\n",
        "State access in Africa is closely connected with the state's ability to physically reach its population. Here the character of a state's transportation network plays a vital role since it constitutes the foundational infrastructure that permits the state to build and maintain institutions that can ensure social order [@Muller-Crepon.etal2021: 568]. Following Müller-Crepon and Müller-Crepon *et. al.* measuring state accessibility is done based on the average travel time from a country's capital or regional capitals to individuals inside an ethnic group's settlement areas. This is calculated using a weighted population average that has the following mathematical form:\n",
        "\n",
        "$$\n",
        "state\\space access_g = ln\\bigg(\\frac{1}{I_g}\\sum_{i=1}^{I_g}1+time_C,_i\\bigg)\n",
        "$$\n",
        "\n",
        "Here $time_C,_i$ denotes the travelling time from the country or regional capital, $C$, to an individual $i$ using the shortest possible path. $I_g$ enumerates individuals belonging to an ethnic settlement area ($g$), constituting the population weight used in the formula. Using a population-weighted mean ensures that the travelling time to more densely populated areas is weighted higher than that of sparsely populated ones. I log transform the measure, since it better captures the convex relationship between the capacity of the state to assert itself in an area and travelling time [@Muller-Crepon2021: 2]. To compute the formula gridded raster data on travelling times and population counts are used together with EPR polygons to devise the final measure. Data on travelling time is provided by Müller-Crepon, who uses digitised footpaths and road networks of Africa to estimate the travelling time from a given grid-cell to either the national or regional capital per year. The approach is similar to Google maps and considers the condition of roads when estimating travelling time [@Muller-Crepon2021]. The main advantage of this data source is the time scale of the data, as it allows us to investigate the within variation in our independent variable. Population data is provided by the WorldPop project that, through the use of UN population census data and covariates, is combined in a machine learning model so to be able to accurately estimate the number of people living inside an ethnic group's settlement area $I_g$ and the approximate location of individual group members $i$ per year [@WorldPop2018]. The thesis opts for the unconstrained version of the dataset that does not take into consideration settlement patterns when estimating population counts, as the accuracy of these data sources has been found to vary through time and between spatial units, thereby limiting the comparative potential of the analysis [@Stevens.etal2015].\\\n",
        "The final measure based on travelling time from the national capital ranges from -0.58 to 4.12, where higher values indicate an increase in the mean travelling time to members of an ethnic group on a log scale.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Security environment\n",
        "\n",
        "Measuring the security environment in which ethnic groups reside in, the number of violent encounters in neighbouring ethnic areas are used. Using ACLED data, a subset of violent encounters are chosen based on whether rebels, militias or other vigilante groups are involved in violence or one-sided violence against government forces, civilians or between the before mentioned groups. These encounters are chosen as research has highlighted that vigilante groups have, in a number of cases, been mobilised as a response to the activity level of these groups [@Zech2016; @Peic2021; @Jentzsch2022]. The number of violent encounters in neighbouring ethnic areas are applied, so to create a spatial lag of the average threat level in neighbouring ethnic groups' settlement area, thereby capturing the potential for aggression towards a given ethnic group. The spatial-lag is given by the following formula, where $N_g$ is the number of neighbouring ethnic groups and $activity_n$ is the activity level in each of the neighbouring areas ($n$).\n",

        "Gauging the presence of rules and norms in a community, the following three binary questions regarding the presence of the bellow are chosen. They are chosen on the ground that they capture both informal and formal rules, but moreover that they have institutional bodies to enforce such rules.\n",

        "\n",
        "The biophysical/material conditions of an ethnic community are measured using two measures.\\\n",
        "Firstly, when measuring the spatial dispersion of a group, this study follows the proposed method by Weidmann of how to calculate the degree that members of an ethnic group is dispersed. The central measure is denoted \"$D$\" where higher values correspond to more dispersed groups, and is calculated using the below formula:\n",
        "\n",
        "$$\n",
        "    D= \\frac{\\underset{i,j \\in\\{1..N\\}, i < j}{\\sum p(c_i) p(c_j) log(d(c_i,c_j))}}{\\underset{i,j \\in\\{1..N\\}, i < j}{\\sum p(c_i) p(c_j)}}\n",
        "$$\n",
        "\n",
        "Using gridded population data from the WorldPop project, the formula uses the number of people inside each settlement cluster, denoted \"$P(C_n)$\" and the logged minimal geodesic distance between each cluster \"$d(…)$\". By computing a population-weighted average of the logged minimal geodesic distances between clusters, a measure is created where the distance between heavily populated clusters is weighted higher than that of sparsely populated ones [@Weidmann2009: 536]. The measure ranges from 0 to 6.31, where lower values indicate that ethnic groups are more centralised, whereas higher values indicates more dispersed ethnic groups.\n",
        "\n",
        "The second measure captures to what extent an ethnic group is cultivating their land using irrigation techniques. The measure is devised using satellite data from *The Copernicus Climate Change Service* (CCI) on land use and population data from the WorldPop project. The land use data is generated using an algorithm that applies different satellites and machine learning classification techniques so to be able to generate yearly assessments of what a given grid-cell of land is being used for. Importantly for this study, the data records whether a grid-cell is classified as \"*Cropland, irrigated or post-flooding*\", indicating if irrigation is used as the primary cultivating technique in an area [@ESA2017]. The final measure is created by combining land use data, ethnic settlement areas and WorldPop population data, enabling the study to calculate the percentage of an ethnic group's members living in cropland areas being irrigated. Moreover, as it is not affected by the dependent variable i.e. conflict related violence, it is ensured that the measure does not induce a systematic bias in the final results [@Schultz.Mankin2019]. The scale of the measure ranges from 0% to 100% where higher values indicate that a larger share of members of an ethnic group living in areas being irrigated.\n",
        "\n",
        "# Designing the statistical model\n",
        "\n",
        "The final data set consists of repeated observations of 196 ethnic groups within 37 African states from 2000 to 2016, resulting in 3009 group years. This data structure allows the study to investigate the hypotheses using a hybrid-multilevel regression model that applies the causal identification strategy found in fixed-effects models while at the same time being able to take into account the nested structure of ethnic groups within countries [@Bell.etal2019; @Allison2005: 32; @Hamaker.Muthén2020; @Morgan2013: 118]. Central to this model is the decomposing of time-varying predictors into two parts; one representing the between-group variation, whereas the other representing the within-group variation. The between-group estimate is the specific mean for group $i$ on the time-varying predictors, which is denoted as: $\\overline{x_i}$, and captures the average effect between groups. The within estimator is calculated using the demeaned method where the time-varying predictor for group $i$ in year $t$ is subtracted from the group mean: $x_i,_t-\\overline{x_i}$ . This estimator is akin to the conditional estimator found in fixed-effect models and controls for unobserved time-invariant confounders [@Allison2005: 33; @Morgan2013: 118].\\\n",
        "\n",
        "When testing time-varying interaction effects in a hybrid multilevel framework two methods have been proposed. Firstly, Schunck argues that the product term between the dependent variable and the interaction variable for group $i$ in year $t$: $x_i,_tz_i,_t$ should as the main predictors, be decomposed into a between estimator, $\\overline{x_iz_i}$, and a within estimator: $x_i,_tz_i,_t-\\overline{x_iz_i}$ [@Schunck2013].\\\n",
        "Opposite to Schunk's approach, Giesselmann and Schmidt-Catran argue that this method will do fine when only the dependent variable is time-varying, but when the interaction term is also time-varying unobserved time-invariant confounders are not controlled for, thus the final estimate will be biased. To obtain an unbiased interaction term, they propose the double demean method where one takes the product between the two demeaned terms: $(x_i,_t-\\overline{x_i})(z_i,_t-\\overline{z_i})$. This product term should when be decomposed into a between term, $\\overline{(x_i,_t-\\overline{x_i})(z_i,_t-\\overline{z_i})}$, and a within component that controls for unobserved time-invariant confounders: $(x_i,_t-\\overline{x_i})(z_i,_t-\\overline{z_i})-\\overline{(x_i,_t-\\overline{x_i})(z_i,_t-\\overline{z_i})}$ [@Giesselmann.Schmidt-Catran2022].\\\n",
        "Based on the above, the analysis will rely on the double demeaned method, though as a sensitivity analysis the Schunck method will also be used.\n",
        "\n",
        "The within estimator will not be able to control for time-varying confounders. As a result, omitted variable bias will be introduced in the analysis. In order to account for that, a series of time-varying confounders on both the group and state level are included in the analysis.\\\n",
        "On the group level, the logged total population of an ethnic group is included, as it can be expected that more populous groups would be more able to mobilise vigilante groups since they have a larger pool of potential recruits that can be enrolled [@Neupert-Wentz2020]. Furthermore, it would seem reasonable to expect that areas, where more people are located are also the areas that will be prioritised by governmental infrastructural developers when considering the location of new roads. Thus, more populous areas are expected to have more developed road networks [@Burrier2019].\\\n",
        "Three other confounders are controlled for on the state level. Firstly, GDP per capita adjusted for inflation is included as it has been found to affect both vigilante mobilisation, road infrastructure and violence levels [@Dao2008; @Peic2021; @Collier.Hoeffler2004; @Fearon.Laitin2003]. Secondly, more democratic states are expected to affect vigilante mobilisation and violence in neighbouring ethnic areas through lower levels of violence inside a state's borders, which is opposite to autocratic states, which are generally connected with higher levels of violence [@Krishnarajan.etal2017]. Measuring the level of democracy is done using the V-dem egalitarian democracy index. The index captures whether a state can be considered an electoral democracy and, moreover, if resources and power are distributed equally among groups [@Coppedge2021]. Thirdly, to account for the general conflict level in a state, a binary measure of whether there is ongoing conflict within a state is provided by the UCDP armed conflict database [@Sundberg.Melander2013]. Its inclusion ensures that the effect on vigilante mobilisation is not a response to the general security situation in the state, as it seems reasonable that both violence in neighbouring ethnic areas and road infrastructure are affected by the overall conflict level in a state.\n",
