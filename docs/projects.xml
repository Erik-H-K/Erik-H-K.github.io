<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>For 25 years, the terrorist organisation al-Shabaab has wrought a reign of terror over Somalia, destabilising the country, terrorising communities, and hampering growth and stability. The organisation gained momentum after the Ethiopian-led invasion of Somalia in 2006, when the parent organisation of al-Shabaab, Islamic Courts Union, was ousted from Mogadishu <span class="citation" data-cites="mengisteab2013">(Mengisteab 2013: 138-139)</span>. In the following years, al-Shabaab asserted itself by controlling large parts of central and southern Somalia, including the capital Mogadishu, and the port city of Kismayo, subsequently forming a quasi-government in these areas <span class="citation" data-cites="bacon2019 polgeonow.com2012">(Bacon and Muibu 2019; polgeonow.com 2012)</span>. However things changed in 2011 when the Transnational Federal Government of Somalia and the African Union led multinational military force, AMISOM, wrested a significant amount of territory from al-Shabaab, including Mogadishu and Kismayo. This resulted in al-Shabaab only controlling mostly rural areas and was forced to revert to its insurgency roots <span class="citation" data-cites="gaid2022">(Gaid 2022)</span>.<br>
Al-Shabab’s control of these areas has since 2012 mostly been unchallenged. From mid-2022 al-Shabaab was again facing threats to its territorial control. Because a coalition between Somali state forces and a selection of Somali clan militias initiated an offensive against the group. The presence of the clan militias has according to some analysts been a sign of a popular uprising against al-Shabaab <span class="citation" data-cites="africaconfidential2022 nor2022">(Africa Confidential 2022; Nor 2022)</span>.<br>
With the launch of the second phase of the offensive in March last year, which by now seemed to be stalled <span class="citation" data-cites="valmary2023 crisisgroup2023">(Valmary 2023; Crisis group 2023)</span>, and the planned withdrawal of African Union military forces from Somalia at the end of this year <span class="citation" data-cites="stares2024">(Stares 2024)</span>, it is necessary that we take a look at the current state of this conflict.<br>
The analysis will use a series of different quantitative data sources and advanced machine learning and statistical methods in order to establish where the offensive has been taking place, and the subsequent character and placement of the reprisal attacks by al-Shabaab. Moreover, the analysis will also seek to assess whether the offensive has changed the size of the land controlled by al-Shabaab, and understand which actors are most prominent in the fight against al-Shabaab.</p>
<p>The period being covered stretches from the first of August 2022 to the end of October 2023. Methodological and analytical decisions are briefly discussed throughout the document, and the related R-code for each section is also attached.<br>

<h1>Data</h1>
<p>Data on conflict events is provided by The Armed Conflict Location &amp; Event Data Project (ACLED). It is generated using news sources, expert and NGO reports on violent and non-violent conflict events in Somalia. Conflict events consist of a series of actions realised by one actor or between multiple actors. Events are categorised as to whether they are battles, attacks on civilians, acts of remote violence in the form of, for example, suicide bombs or drone attacks, and lastly, if they constitute non-violent strategic developments, such as the non-violent transfer of territory <span class="citation" data-cites="raleigh2010">(Raleigh et al. 2010)</span>. The data source is affected by reporting bias, meaning that events that do not get the same amount of media exposure due to a lack of media presence in the area where the event is taking place, i.e., rural areas, or the event has a low number of casualties, are less likely to be sampled <span class="citation" data-cites="weidmann2016">(Weidmann 2016)</span>. In order to combat this bias, the analysis also applies another layer of data points relating to the placement and timing of conflict related fires. Thereby ensuring that conflicts that are not being picked up by ACLED are also included in the analysis. Conflict related fires are obtained using satellite recordings of fires in Somalia, which are subsequently classified by a machine learning model as being either conflict related fires or natural fires. I follow the approach outlined by the Economist <span class="citation" data-cites="theeconomist2023">(The Economist and Solstad 2023)</span>, and train the classifier on the time and the placement of past fires taking into account the cloud cover of the assessed area.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-location-of-the-fight-against-al-shabaab-and-the-groups-fighting-al-shabaab">The location of the fight against al-Shabaab and the groups fighting al-Shabaab</h2>
<p>Looking at the map bellow (figure 1), which depicts the position and number of casualties of attacks and strategic developments against al-Shabaab in the analysed period, we see that the vast majority of such activities are taking place in the Hiraan (19%), Galgaduud (14%), Middle (17%) and Lower Shabelle (11%) regions. A majority of these activities against al-Shabaab are either armed clashes with the group or violent seizure of the group’s territory by Somali government forces. These activities in the Hiraan region resulted in 758 causalities, whereas in the Middle and Lower Shabelle they resulted in a total of 1924 causalities. However, another major activity is the non-violent seizure of al-Shabaab territory by government forces, which corroborates reports that al-Shabaab forces have reverted to their previous tactic of withdrawal without confrontation, a tactic they had previously only displayed when confronted by AU forces<span class="citation" data-cites="gaid2022">(Gaid 2022: 32)</span>. To a lesser degree than the three before-mentioned regions, the fight against al-Shabaab is also taking place in Galgaduud, Bay, and Lower Juba, where battles and explosions have killed a total of 228 people.</p>

<p>Reports have highlighted that the offensive against al-Shabaab was largely initiated by clans in al-Shabaab-controlled areas in the Hiraan region whom, because of the recent drought in Somalia, refused to pay taxes to al-Shabaab’s tax collectors and therefore revolted against al-Shabaab <span class="citation" data-cites="africaconfidential2022 nor2022">(Africa Confidential 2022; Nor 2022)</span>, a finding that this analysis confirms. Because looking at table table 3, which shows activities against al-Shabaab for different actors per region, it becomes evident that in the Hiraan region, 14.08% of the activities against al-Shabaab were initiated by the Hiraan-based clan militias Macawiisley and Hawadle, though Somali military and special forces still account for 70% of the activities against al-Shabaab in the region. These militia can be categorised as a community-initiated self-defence force, because the group mainly consists of locales who, in the absence of government-sponsored security guarantees, themselves initiate the provision of their own and their community’s security <span class="citation" data-cites="ibrahimshire2022 nor2022 schuberth2015">(Ibrahim Shire 2022; Nor 2022; Schuberth 2015)</span>. It is not new for members of especially Macawiisley Clan Militia to revolt against al-Shabaab as this group successfully took up arms against al-Shabaab in 2014, owing also to al-Shabaab’s excessive taxation of people in the Hiraan region <span class="citation" data-cites="ibrahimshire2022">(Ibrahim Shire 2022: 17)</span>. This finding confirms the result of another study of the mobilisation of community-initiated self-defence forces, that such groups are more likely to emerge in a conflict if its members in the past have successfully mobilised self-defence forces <span class="citation" data-cites="osorio">(Osorio, Schubiger, and Weintraub, n.d.)</span>. A noteworthy difference between the Macawiisley revolt in 2014 and the present one is the duration because the former ended rather quickly due to the lack of government support <span class="citation" data-cites="ibrahimshire2022">(Ibrahim Shire 2022)</span>. Thus, the current one’s longevity seems to some extent to be a product of the current government’s swift support to the clan militia.</p>

<p>A similar picture also emerges in Middle Shabelle, where it is the Abgal Clan Militia, who, together with Somali security forces, accounts for the majority of activity against al-Shabaab. A reason for the participation of the Abgal clans in the offensive could be because the current president of Somalia, Hassan Shikh Mohamud, himself comes from the Abgal clan. Interestingly, this findings goes against reports of the non-participation of the Abgal clan in the offensive against al-Shabaab <span class="citation" data-cites="africaconfidential2022">(Africa Confidential 2022)</span> .</p>
<p>Table 3 also reveals the stationary character of clan militias, as their activity level is limited to specific regions, since they are rarely active in other regions than their home region. The only actors who are active across regions are the Somali military forces. This finding highlights a special characteristic of the offensive against al-Shabaab; it is in some ways, dependent on whether government forces can convince local clan militias to take up arms against al-Shabaab, in order for the offensive to move into new regions. It should be noted that in regions such as Bay and Galgaduud it is government forces, which for the most part is leading the fight against al-Shabaab, with minor support from clan militias.</p>
<p>Moving from the individual regions to the whole of Somalia, figure 2 depicts the number of encounters against al-Shabaab per actor found in the security arena in Somalia. The thickness of the line between an actor and al-Shabaab indicates the number of violent or strategic encounters between the actors. Thereby, the figure allows the analysis to understand which actors are most involved in the fight against al-Shabaab. With 423 encounters with al-Shabaab it becomes clear that throughout the offensive it is SNA who have been leading the fight against al-Shabaab. The organisation has in 1/3 of the time engaged in battles with al-Shabaab and the violent seizure of territory, but 50% of SNA activity against al-Shabaab involves the non-violent seizure of territory from the group. Frequently SNA forces are accompanied by either Macawiisley or Abgal clan militias in different operations, but the militias also often face al-Shabaab themselves, thereby underpinning the active role of clan militias in the offensive.</p>
<p>Looking at international actors operating in Somalia, in the form of the AU lead ATMIS mission and countries such as Turkey or the USA, it is evident that of all the international actors engaged, the USA’s army is heavily invested in the fight against al-Shabaab. However, these activities is mostly airstrikes or the use of drones. Contrary to this, the other international actors’ engagements in the conflict seems minimal and also when comparing to past offensives against al-Shabaab <span class="citation" data-cites="gaid2022">(Gaid 2022)</span>. In total, ATMIS forces had only 34 encounters with al-Shabaab, which for the most part have been the use of remote explosions such as drones or assisting in securing a former al-Shabaab controlled area. Though, ATMIS forces have, in a few instances, fought directly against al-Shabaab or alongside SNA forces when capturing villages from al-Shabaab, in for instance, lower Shabelle.</p>

<p>Exploring how AS has retaliated, figure 3 shows the location and the number of casualties of al-Shabaab attacks and bombs in Somalia. The majority of the attacks in the studied period took place in administrative region of Banadir, i.e., Mogadishu (25.8%), Lower Shabelle (25.4%), and lower Juba (12,6%). A common trait found among these events are that they are mostly armed attacks against government forces and civilians. Approximately 15% of all events involving AS were directed against civilians, killing around 730 people. In Mogadishu, al-Shabaab has conducted several hit-and-run attacks against military forces and civilians, and conducted suicide bombings in public places, killing a total of 758 people in the city and surrounding areas. Among these attacks was a major suicide attack close to the Somali ministry of education, killing 121 civilians and injuring 300.<br>
A similar pattern also exists in Lower Shabelle and Lower Juba, though with fewer casualties. Although the activity level of al-Shabaab in the Galgaduud and Hiraan regions is lower than that of other regions, 2046 people have been killed by al-Shabaab in these two regions, making it the regions where most people have been killed by al-Shabaab attacks.</p>

<h1>Territorial control</h1>
<p>As highlighted by scholars investigating civil wars it is important to understand which areas are controlled by either rebel forces or the government since it affects the behavior of both parties <span class="citation" data-cites="kalyvas2006">(Kalyvas 2006)</span>. In the case of AS having a larger area means that they can more easily mobilize the needed resources for waging a war, which for example can be done either through taxation of the locale population, or forced conscription of recruits to AS military units.</p>
<section id="territorial-control-using-a-grid-of-hexagons" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="territorial-control-using-a-grid-of-hexagons">Territorial control using a grid of hexagons</h2>
<p>Opposite other analyses of territorial control, which view control as a binary phenomenon between being controlled or not controlled, this analysis operationalizes it as a continuous variable. Hereby, territorial control is understood as a spectrum with two extremes; fully controlled by AS or fully controlled by the Somali government. However, control also falls in between the two extremes since territory, to a varying degree, can be controlled by the two actors or be disputed. This approach is advantageous as it enables the analysis to capture the floating character of territorial control in asymmetrical civil wars such as the one in Somalia.<br>
To gauge territorial control the analysis follows Theresa Anders’ approach, where territorial control is firstly operationalised using a hexagonal grid as the spatial unit of interest, where each hexagonal cell spans 0.20 decimal degrees <span class="citation" data-cites="anders2020">(Anders 2020)</span>. Using these spatial units instead of administrative regions allows the analysis to assess territorial control independently of administrative borders.<br>
Secondly, in order to assess territorial control of a grid cell I apply the following three data sources: <strong>1)</strong> Maps of AS-controlled areas in Somalia for August 2022 and September 2022 provided by the Critical Threats Project <span class="citation" data-cites="karr">(Karr, n.d.)</span> to gauge which hexagons are <em>i)</em> fully controlled by AS, <em>ii)</em> partly controlled by AS, and <em>iii)</em> are AS attacks zones. <strong>2)</strong> Using a specialized coding scheme each recorded event in the ACLED data set is assigned a unique numerical value depending on the nature of a control-related event and whether it was AS, government forces, or other domestic and international government allies of the government who performed the action. Lower values are associated with AS control whereas higher values with Somali government control. <strong>3)</strong> Lastly, the location and time of conflict-related fires are also applied as an indicator of armed attacks, and thereby a sign that an area is contested.<br>
The events are then aggregated to the hexagonal cells on a monthly time frame. Territorial control of a grid cell is thus assigned based on the occurrence of a specific event within a cell. New events cause a cell to update the coded level of territorial control based on the event type. In the case of multiple events occurring in the same grid cell month, the analysis averages across them. Cells with no events in a given month are imputed to mirror the control value of the cell in the previous month.<br>
</p>
<p>The final result of the above approach is shown in figure 4 below for southern and central Somalia. This part of Somalia is chosen since it is in these areas that that al-Shabaab controls territory, and figure 1 indicates that the fight against al-Shabaab has for the most part been taking part in these areas.<br>
What becomes evident is that al-Shabaab control has only been significantly reduced in the central regions of Hiiran, Middle Shebelle, and Galgaadud, whereas the group’s control of the southern regions has not changed significantly. This lack of the Somali forces’ ability to capture land in the southern part of the country could be an indicator of the governments’ inability to persuade locale clans to take up arms against al-Shabaab.<br>
It also becomes clear that no major changes in territorial control have happen since August of 2023, a sign of the second phase of the offensive has stalled.</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="interpolating-territorial-control">Interpolating territorial control</h3>
<p>Despite the above advantages of applying a grid to assess territorial control, it falls short of taking into account that territorial control seldom follows the shape of a hexagonal cell and how possible predictors influence territorial control in an area. One could for instance think that the state’s ability to project power and hence control of an area is conditioned on its ability to transport military personnel and equipment to areas within its borders <span class="citation" data-cites="scott1999">(Scott 1999)</span>. To make up for these disadvantages the analysis, besides the monthly grid of territorial control, also uses a spatial interpolation method called Kriging in order to estimate territorial control in Somalia. This geostatistical method uses a limited set of sampled data points to estimate the value of a variable, in our case territorial control, over a continuous spatial field <span class="citation" data-cites="gräler2016">(Gräler, Pebesma, and Heuvelink 2016)</span>.<br>
I will briefly describe my approach: First, a 1 x 1-km raster grid of Southern and Central Somalia is created, where each grid cell contains the following information: <em>i)</em> average transportation time from regional capitals to the grid cell as a measure of state reach <span class="citation" data-cites="müller-crepon2021">(Müller-Crepon, Hunziker, and Cederman 2021)</span>, <em>ii)</em> population density <span class="citation" data-cites="worldpop">(WorldPop, n.d.)</span>, and <em>iii)</em> nighttime lights intensity as a proxy for economic development <span class="citation" data-cites="elvidge2017">(Elvidge et al. 2017)</span>. Hereafter, I extract one point from each hexagon cell in the monthly grid of territorial control described earlier (figure 4) together with the corresponding territorial control value from the cell in question. The centroid of each hexagon is chosen as the point being extracted. This is followed by universal kriging interpolation that uses the location of each point, the corresponding territorial control value, state reach, population density, and nighttime lights, in order to estimate territorial control for each 1 x 1-km grid cell. Thus, achieving a more fine grained assessment where the effect of a pre-defined spatial shape does not affect the final assessment and covariates of interest affecting control are moreover included.<br>
However, this approach comes with a caveat. By using the centroid of each hexagon-cell as the foundation for conducting kriging interpolation we lose spatial accuracy since the point sampled does not reflect the location of the ACLED events and conflict related fires. Though in especially the case where also polygons of al-Shabbab control and attack areas are included in the model, it is necessary to convert the polygons into points, which when compared with the chosen method has the effect that the importance of ACLED events and conflict-related fires are downplayed, thus leading to a misrepresentation of territorial control. This comparative analysis of the two approaches can be attached if needed. Moreover, using the hexagonal-grid ensures that the assessment of areas where no events have occurred in a given month are still included in the analysis due to the hexagonal-grid’s use of past value when inferring the current state of a cell if nothing has happened.<br>
The above process is computationally heavy, and because of that I have only performed kriging interpolation for October 2023, i.e., the last month of the studied period. Figure 5 depicts the results using a continuous measure (press drop down arrow to view), whereas the same measurement has been turned into a discrete measure in figure 6 in order to ease interpretation.</p>

  <title>Do It Yourself Community Security - Why people mobilise vigilante groups on the African continent</title>

<section id="summary" class="level1">
<h1>Summary</h1>
<p>The provision of security in areas of the African continent governed by fragile states and dominated by frequent conflict is typically seen as limited, if not non-existent. An important question becomes how do people in these areas cope with this situation? Typically, it is assumed that they would either flee or choose to join state forces or rebel groups. Nevertheless, it has increasingly become evident that communities in these areas themselves actually choose to take up arms and provide for their own security by forming vigilante groups, also known as self-defense force or communal militias. However, research tend to lump vigilante groups together with political militias, and therefore see such community initiatives as solely a project commissioned by governments.<br>
This analysis departs from the before mentioned approach by arguing that vigilante groups and political militias are distinct categories and viewing vigilante groups as governments’ extended arm limits our theoretical understanding of why such groups emerge.<br>
Testing what drives the emergence of vigilante groups, this analysis uses digitised road maps and the number of violent encounters in neighboring areas, in order to illuminate how different security environments affects the mobilization of vigilante groups. Though since mobilizing vigilante groups is, in essence, a form of collective action, it is moreover investigated how communities’ ability to conduct collective action condition mobilization in insecure environments. This claim is tested by creating a unique measure that includes data on both social and natural environmental attributes of communities.<br>
Using unique panel data of ethnic communities a negative binomial hybrid multilevel regression model is utilized to test empirical the drivers of vigilante group emergence.<br>
</p>
<p>Core findings:</p>
<ul>
<li>Vigilante groups have become more active on the African continent in recent years.</li>
<li>It is only security environments becoming more hostile that significantly affect vigilante group emergence.</li>
<li>The effect of state access on vigilante group emergence is conditioned on both social and natural environmental factors, though the findings are not robust.</li>
</ul>

<section id="no-such-thing-as-an-ungoverned-space---an-introduction" class="level1">
<h1>No such thing as an ungoverned space - An introduction</h1>
<p>The state is often defined by its monopoly on legitimate violence and control over a defined territory <span class="citation" data-cites="Weber1926">(Weber 1926)</span>. Fragile or collapsed states, unable to meet these criteria, are commonly seen as chaotic and insecure, where life becomes “nasty, brutish, and short” <span class="citation" data-cites="Hobbes2017">(Hobbes 2017)</span>. This view dominates both academic and policy discussions, especially concerning regions like the Sahel, where many see widespread anarchy <span class="citation" data-cites="Glawion2020 Fukuyama2004 OECD2020">(Glawion 2020; Fukuyama 2004; OECD 2020)</span>.</p>
<p>However, the reality is more nuanced. While central governments in fragile states may be weak, various non-state actors—including traditional authorities, rebel groups, and vigilante organizations — often step in to govern and provide security <span class="citation" data-cites="Zartman1995 Boege.etal2009">(Zartman 1995; Boege, Brown, and Clements 2009)</span>. This phenomenon is known as “hybrid order,” where state authority is shared, not entirely absent <span class="citation" data-cites="Risse-Kappen2011 Glawion2020">(Risse-Kappen 2011; Glawion 2020)</span>.</p>
<p>This analysis explores how civilians in these hybrid orders respond to insecurity, focusing on the rise of vigilante groups. These groups, composed of ordinary citizens, take on security roles in the absence of effective state or rebel forces <span class="citation" data-cites="Schuberth2015 Frowd2022">(Schuberth 2015; Frowd 2022)</span>. This is an interesting phenomenon, because, rather than fleeing or joining armed factions in a conflict, these communities instead chooses to mobilize, in order, to protect themselves.</p>
<p>Using data on vigilante activity across Africa from 2000 to 2016, this analysis will try to understand what drives their formation. Consequently, this analysis diverges firstly from the conventional view of fragile states as purely anarchic, and secondly highlights how local populations are not only passive bystanders in violent conflicts, but actually possesses agency when trying to create order and security in otherwise ungoverned spaces <span class="citation" data-cites="Osorio.etal2021 Jentzsch2022">(Osorio, Schubiger, and Weintraub 2021; Jentzsch 2022)</span>.</p>
</section>
<section id="whom-and-why" class="level1">
<h1>Whom and why?</h1>
<p>I will in this section outline what I mean by vigilante groups. Moreover, drawing on theories of mobilization and of the security environment, I will deduce predictions of why vigilante groups appear and their level of activity. Predictions that subsequently will guide me on the design of my statistical model.</p>
<section id="vigilante-groups-as-community-based-actors" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="vigilante-groups-as-community-based-actors">Vigilante groups as community based actors</h2>
<p>Conflicts are normally viewed through the bipolar framework of governments on one side and rebels on the other. However, if we enlarge the number of distinct actors in this theatre of violence our ability to grasp violent conflicts will increase. I will begin by considering the overarching category of <em>non-state actors</em>, which include rebels, private military companies (PMC), and Community-Based Armed Groups (CBAG). CBAGs distinguishes themselves from the two former actor categories by 1) not seeking independence from a government or colonial power, 2) aims to protect the status quo or property rather than capturing the state or pursuing a revolutionary agenda <span class="citation" data-cites="Schuberth2015 Peic2021 Jentzsch2022">(Schuberth 2015: 299; Peic 2021: 1022; Jentzsch 2022: 14)</span>, which is the case of rebels, and 3) have informal relationships with sponsors, unlike PMCs, which operate under formal legal contracts <span class="citation" data-cites="Schuberth2015">(Schuberth 2015: 298)</span>. We can further subdivide CBAGs into the following three categories: vigilante groups, militias, and gangs. Vigilante groups are primarily concerned with local security. They are often formed by local citizens to defend their communities from threats, both internal and external. These groups are typically organized from the bottom-up and operate at the village level <span class="citation" data-cites="Schuberth2015 Jentzsch2022 Barter2013 IbrahimShire2022">(Schuberth 2015: 300; Jentzsch 2022: 16; Barter 2013: 79-80; Ibrahim Shire 2022: 4-5)</span>. Vigilante groups may also be referred to as anti-crime groups or civilian self-defense forces <span class="citation" data-cites="Schuberth2015 Peic2021">(Schuberth 2015: 301-303; Peic 2021: 1022)</span>. Militias, on the other hand, are driven by political goals. They form a patron-client relationship with political or ethnic leaders, who provide incentives in exchange for using violence against rivals. Militias are usually mobilized from the top-down, with members motivated by political or ethnic ties <span class="citation" data-cites="Dearing2021 Reno2007 Schuberth2015">(Dearing 2021; Reno 2007: 102; Schuberth 2015: 305)</span>. Lastly, gangs, such as drug cartels, are primarily economically motivated <span class="citation" data-cites="Schuberth2015">(Schuberth 2015: 308)</span>.</p>

<section id="state-accessibility" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="state-accessibility">State accessibility</h3>
<p>Vigilante groups form in response to security needs where the state fails to provide adequate protection. Civilians mobilize vigilante groups when insecurity rises in regions where the state lacks control or cannot monopolize violence <span class="citation" data-cites="Chojnacki.Branovic2011">(Chojnacki and Branović 2011: 95)</span>. In some cases, state fragility leads to an absence of security, encouraging civilians to take action. Vigilante groups emerge in areas with limited state presence, while militias are more likely to form where the state has a strong military foothold <span class="citation" data-cites="Barter2013 Peic2021">(Barter 2013; Peic 2021)</span>. This trend is observed in places like Latin America, Asia, and the Middle East, where vigilante groups appear in ungoverned spaces <span class="citation" data-cites="Arjona.Kalyvas2009">(Arjona and Kalyvas 2009)</span>. Thus we can expect that the activity level of vigilante groups are closely linked to the state’s ability to access and control a region <span class="citation" data-cites="Muller-Crepon.etal2021">(Müller-Crepon, Hunziker, and Cederman 2021)</span>.</p>
</section>
<section id="a-hostile-security-environment" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="a-hostile-security-environment">A hostile security environment</h3>
<p>The nature of the security environment plays a key role in vigilante group mobilization. Scholars have highlighted how the balance of power between state and rebel forces, as well as the tactics they use, can drive civilians to form vigilante groups. In Mozambique, military stalemates and lack of security guarantees led to the rise of such groups <span class="citation" data-cites="Jentzsch2022">(Jentzsch 2022: 175)</span>. Similarly, in Indonesia, repeated rebel attacks against specific ethnic groups sparked vigilante activity <span class="citation" data-cites="Barter2013">(Barter 2013: 89)</span>.</p>
<p>Vigilante groups can also emerge in non-civil war environments. For example, in Nigeria and Mexico, groups like the Bakassi Boys were formed in response to criminal gangs <span class="citation" data-cites="Meagher2012 Osorio.etal2021">(Meagher 2012; Osorio, Schubiger, and Weintraub 2021)</span>. In other cases, vigilante groups have mobilized to counter rival ethnic groups <span class="citation" data-cites="Thomson2019 Peic2021">(Thomson 2019; Peic 2021)</span>.</p>
<p>The common theme is that civilians mobilize vigilante groups in response to perceived threats. To better understand this, we can apply Zech’s concept of the “balance of threat,” inspired by structural realism in international relations <span class="citation" data-cites="Zech2016">(Zech 2016: 31)</span>. Just as states balance against perceived threats to their survival, civilian communities may do the same when faced with local threats. According to Walt’s theory, threat perception depends on factors like power, proximity, offensive capabilities, and intentions <span class="citation" data-cites="Walt1985">(Walt 1985: 8-9)</span>.</p>
<p>Thus, when civilians face hostile actors or uncertain environments, their demand for security increases, and vigilante mobilization follows. This pattern is seen in cases like South Sudan, where the South Sudan Defense Force formed to counter the rebel Sudanese People’s Liberation Army <span class="citation" data-cites="Arnold2007">(Arnold 2007)</span>, and in Colombia, where civilians formed self-defense groups to protect their communities <span class="citation" data-cites="Nussio2011">(Nussio 2011)</span>.</p>

<section id="having-the-ability-to-mobilize---how-strong-communities-help-mobilize-vigilante-groups" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="having-the-ability-to-mobilize---how-strong-communities-help-mobilize-vigilante-groups">Having the ability to mobilize - how strong communities help mobilize vigilante groups</h3>
<p>Explanations focused on a lack of state security and a hostile security environment describe how civilians, due to a lack of security guarantees, are forced to provide for their own safety in a market without a formal security monopolist. However, it would be naive to assume that vigilante group formation is an automatic response to insecurity, as seen in the case of refugees fleeing conflict zones rather than forming vigilante groups. For example, during the second civil war in Southern Sudan, despite attacks from the Sudan People’s Liberation Army on government-free villages, only a few organized vigilante groups for protection <span class="citation" data-cites="Blocq2014">(Blocq 2014: 716)</span>. A similar pattern was observed in the Peruvian civil war <span class="citation" data-cites="Zech2016">(Zech 2016)</span>.</p>
<p>This suggests that the willingness of civilians to form vigilante groups in response to insecurity is influenced by other factors. From a rational choice perspective, one such factor is the need to overcome the collective action problem, given that mobilizing vigilante groups is a collective effort <span class="citation" data-cites="Osorio.etal2021">(Osorio, Schubiger, and Weintraub 2021: 1568)</span>. According to rational choice theory, agents will only participate if the expected benefits outweigh the costs <span class="citation" data-cites="Olson1968">(Olson 1968)</span>. Vigilante participation often offers little individual benefit, especially when compared to the risks and effort involved, such as economic costs, exposure to violence, and the lack of protected accommodation <span class="citation" data-cites="Arjona.Kalyvas2009 Peic2021">(Arjona and Kalyvas 2009; Peic 2021)</span>. Moreover, the uncertainty of how many others will join further discourages participation, as a smaller group increases personal risk <span class="citation" data-cites="Lohmann1994 Chenoweth.Stephan2011">(Lohmann 1994: 59; Chenoweth and Stephan 2011: 39-40)</span>. As Magagna aptly notes, “joining a vigilante group is a dangerous deed, and many would prefer to free-ride if they cannot predict they will not be killed in the process” <span class="citation" data-cites="Magagna2019">(Magagna 2019: 46)</span>.</p>
<p>However, social structures within communities can alter this cost-benefit analysis, making collective action more likely <span class="citation" data-cites="Lichbach1995 Putnam.etal1993 Fukuyama2001 Ostrom.Ahn2007 Oliver1993 Granovetter1973">(Lichbach 1995; Putnam, Leonardi, and Nanetti 1993; Fukuyama 2001; Ostrom and Ahn 2007; Oliver 1993; Granovetter 1973)</span>. Research shows that pro-government vigilante groups often emerge from traditional tribal communities, which use vigilante membership to pursue private agendas like inter-tribal feuds or defend their autonomy from outside intervention <span class="citation" data-cites="Thomson2019 Peic2021 Magagna2019">(Thomson 2019; Peic 2021: 1027-1029; Magagna 2019: 36)</span>. These communities may mobilize vigilante groups more easily because of pre-existing social structures that facilitate collective action <span class="citation" data-cites="Humphreys.Weinstein2008 Forney2015 Hoffman2007 Zech2016 Jentzsch2022 Blocq2014 Menkhaus2007">(Humphreys and Weinstein 2008: 451; Forney 2015: 830; Hoffman 2007: 642; Zech 2016: 191; Jentzsch 2022; Blocq 2014; Menkhaus 2007)</span>.</p>
<p>These examples show that for vigilante groups to form, potentiel members must be embedded in social structures that reshape their cost-benefit analysis, making participation more likely. However, the precise causal mechanisms linking social structures to vigilante group formation remain varied and inconsistent across cases.</p>
<p>Based on Lichbach’s extensive review of collective action in rebel groups, this study adopts the concept of community as the unit of social structure. Lichbach defines communities as those characterized by strong social institutions, shared beliefs, and collective behavior <span class="citation" data-cites="Lichbach1995">(Lichbach 1995: 111)</span>. To further understand how community attributes help overcome the collective action problem, this study applies the Institutional Analysis and Development (IAD) framework developed by Ostrom and colleagues <span class="citation" data-cites="Ostrom.etal1994">(Ostrom, Gardner, and Walker 1994)</span>. Given the bottom-up nature of vigilante groups, the IAD framework offers a suitable model for understanding the mechanisms behind their emergence. The framework identifies three components:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><em>Attributes of Community</em>: The structure of the more general community that the arena is situated in.</li>
<li><em>Rules</em>: Formal and informal rules used by participants as prescriptions of the kind of behaviour that are required, prohibited, and permitted.</li>
<li><em>Biophysical/Material Conditions</em>: The attributes of the biophysical/material condition that the actors act upon <span class="citation" data-cites="Ostrom2006 McGinnis2011">(Ostrom 2006: 15; McGinnis 2011: 172)</span>.</li>
</ol>
<p>Using the three factors as a framework for theorising which attributes of a community affect the action situation in such a way that it facilitates collective action, and together with literature relating to the subject of collective action, the study will go through each factor and describe the mechanisms linking the individual factor and collective action.</p>
<section id="attributes-of-community" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="attributes-of-community">Attributes of Community:</h4>
<p>For successful vigilante mobilization, an organizational focal point is necessary. Granovetter’s theory suggests that the nature of social networks plays a key role: strong ties form isolated cliques, while weak ties connect more agents and facilitate broader information flow, reducing the transaction costs of obtaining critical information <span class="citation" data-cites="Granovetter1973 Ostrom2015">(Granovetter 1973; Ostrom 2015: 190, 194)</span>. In collective action, information on others’ participation is crucial as it helps agents evaluate risks and costs associated with violent actions <span class="citation" data-cites="Lohmann1994 Oliver1993">(Lohmann 1994; Oliver 1993)</span>. Additionally, shared norms can create expectations for collective action, where non-participation may result in community sanctions, such as restricted access to common resources <span class="citation" data-cites="Ostrom2015 Mason2004">(Ostrom 2015: 194; Mason 2004: 17)</span>.</p>
<p>Marwell et al.’s simulations indicate that weak ties centralizing around an organizational focal point significantly influence collective action <span class="citation" data-cites="Marwell.etal1988">(Marwell, Oliver, and Prahl 1988)</span>. Social institutions, such as governing councils or neighborhoods, can also act as mobilizing structures, driving collective engagement <span class="citation" data-cites="Mason2004">(Mason 2004)</span>.</p>
<p>A second mechanism is the existence of pre-established cooperative arrangements. Communities that engage in cooperative agricultural production, for instance, often exhibit stronger norms of cooperation and reciprocity <span class="citation" data-cites="Henrich.etal2001">(Henrich et al. 2001)</span>. This link between productive cooperation and collective action is observed in various studies on agricultural practices in Brazil and China <span class="citation" data-cites="Gneezy.etal2016 Talhelm.etal2014">(Gneezy, Leibbrandt, and List 2016; Talhelm et al. 2014)</span>. Communities that treat land as a common good tend to mobilize protests and collective action more effectively than those with private property systems <span class="citation" data-cites="Katz2000 Trasberg2021 Mearns1996 Boone2014">(Katz 2000; Trasberg 2021; Mearns 1996; Boone 2014)</span>.</p>
<p>These arrangements foster long-term commitments, reciprocity, and visibility of non-participation, increasing the likelihood of collective security efforts and providing enforcement mechanisms for noncompliance <span class="citation" data-cites="Axelrod2006 Zech2016 Tsai2007">(Axelrod 2006; Zech 2016; Tsai 2007)</span>.</p>
</section>
<section id="rules" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="rules">Rules</h4>
<p>To understand how rules influence vigilante group mobilization, it’s essential to examine whether existing institutions provide formal arrangements that shape agents’ incentives. Rules, both formal and informal, dictate which actions are required, prohibited, or permitted, shaping the action situation <span class="citation" data-cites="Ostrom2006 Ostrom2015">(Ostrom 2006: 17-18; Ostrom 2015: 51)</span>.</p>
<p>Rules impose costs on specific actions, either material (e.g., monetary) or immaterial (e.g., loss of reputation), which can deter agents from rule-breaking due to future cooperation risks <span class="citation" data-cites="Ostrom2015">(Ostrom 2015: 98)</span>. In collective action, rules help sustain cooperation by ensuring agents trust that their cooperation will be reciprocated and by fostering a general sense of reciprocity <span class="citation" data-cites="Lichbach1995">(Lichbach 1995: 129-134)</span>. The effectiveness of rules depends on the presence of formal or informal institutions that enforce compliance <span class="citation" data-cites="Lichbach1995 Ostrom2006">(Lichbach 1995: 132; Ostrom 2006: 20)</span>.</p>
<p>In some ethnic communities, customary law serves as the basis for internal decision-making and judicial processes <span class="citation" data-cites="Holzinger.etal2019 Eck2014 Wig.Kromrey2018">(Holzinger et al. 2019; Eck 2014; Wig and Kromrey 2018)</span>. A study in Uganda shows that in institutional settings with universal norms of reciprocity and third-party enforcement, individuals prone to free-riding are more likely to participate in collective action <span class="citation" data-cites="Habyarimana.etal2009">(Habyarimana et al. 2009)</span>. Similarly, in China, larger clans in rural villages enhance cooperation through informal enforcement of reciprocity <span class="citation" data-cites="Xu.Yao2015">(Xu and Yao 2015)</span>. Studies also highlight the positive impact of general enforcement rules on farmers’ contributions to common pool resource maintenance <span class="citation" data-cites="Cao.etal2020 Zang.etal2021">(Cao, Zhang, and He 2020; Zang, Wang, and Su 2021)</span>.</p>
<p>In conclusion, both formal and informal rules affect the ability of communities to mobilize vigilante groups by fostering reciprocity and influencing agents’ cost-benefit analyses.

<p>Biophysical/Material Conditions</p>
<p>The physical environment plays a crucial role in rural communities’ ability to create and manage collective goods, as well as their potential for mobilizing violent collective action. There are two primary ways this characteristic impacts collective action.</p>
<p>First, spatial features, such as population density, influence social networks. Densely populated areas foster more frequent interactions, improving opportunities for collective action <span class="citation" data-cites="Weidmann2009">(Weidmann 2009: 538)</span>. In contrast, isolated communities, like French smallholder peasants, tend to be self-reliant, with small social networks centered on the family. This isolation hinders the development of class-based political organization and collective action, as observed in various countries <span class="citation" data-cites="Marx1852 Paige1975 Stinchcombe1961">(Marx 1852: 62; Paige 1975: 35; Stinchcombe 1961: 45-46)</span>.</p>
<p>Second, the biophysical features of the land shape social interactions and agricultural production methods. For instance, Boserup’s study of hoe versus plough cultivation found that cultivation methods influenced gender norms, with ploughing requiring more upper-body strength, giving men an advantage and leading to gender-specific roles <span class="citation" data-cites="Boserup1972">(Boserup 1972)</span>. This finding is supported by a large-N study on cultivation methods and gender norms <span class="citation" data-cites="Alesina.etal2013">(Alesina, Giuliano, and Nunn 2013)</span>. Similarly, norms of masculinity in America differed between pastoralists and agriculturalists, with the former developing a “culture of honor” that encouraged violent retaliation to uphold justice <span class="citation" data-cites="Cohen.etal1996 Grosjean2014">(Cohen et al. 1996; Grosjean 2014)</span>.</p>
<p>Irrigation systems also play a key role in fostering cooperation. Wittfogel’s study on hydro societies shows that large-scale irrigation projects in arid regions required collective effort, leading to the development of centralized bureaucracies, as seen in ancient Egypt and Babylon <span class="citation" data-cites="Wittfogel1957">(Wittfogel 1957: 18)</span>. Ostrom’s research on common pool resources highlights how irrigation systems create norms of cooperation, as users develop complex institutions to manage resources sustainably <span class="citation" data-cites="Ostrom2015 Ostrom.Gardner1993 Lam.Ostrom2010">(Ostrom 2015; Ostrom and Gardner 1993; Lam and Ostrom 2010)</span>.</p>
<p>Irrigation systems not only demonstrate successful social mobilization but also serve as organizational focal points for social interaction. Studies show that communities relying on irrigation, such as rice farmers in China, have stronger norms of collectivism compared to wheat farmers, due to the higher labor and cooperation demands of rice cultivation <span class="citation" data-cites="Talhelm.etal2014">(Talhelm et al. 2014)</span>. Similarly, farmers in the Philippines involved in irrigation schemes display more cooperative behavior than those relying on rainfed techniques <span class="citation" data-cites="Tsusaka.etal2015 Fujiie.etal2005">(Tsusaka et al. 2015; Fujiie, Hayami, and Kikuchi 2005)</span>. In Pakistan and India, traditional irrigation systems are seen as essential to community structure and social interaction <span class="citation" data-cites="Mustafa.Qazi2007 vonCarnap2017">(Mustafa and Qazi 2007; von Carnap 2017)</span>. In conclusion, rural areas that depend on irrigation tend to develop strong norms of cooperation and extensive social networks, making them more capable of mobilizing vigilante groups.</p>

<h1>Data and operationalisation</h1>
<p>The empirical analysis is conducted using ethnic settlement areas as the spatial unit of analysis. The choice of ethnic groups is grounded in the fact that ethnic groups on the African function as an essential community identifier for individuals <span class="citation" data-cites="Ekeh1975">(Ekeh 1975: 107)</span>. As a result, it allows the study to come closer to the actual social institutions that shape peoples’ behavior, thereby more accurately gauge how communities condition vigilante mobilization.<br>
Data on ethnic settlement areas are provided by the Geo-referencing Ethnic Power Relations (GeoEPR hereafter) project, which collects information on the relationship between state power and politically relevant ethnic groups. The project defines ethnicity as: “<em>any subjectively experienced sense of commonality based on the belief in common ancestry and shared culture</em>”, and accounts a group as being politically relevant if a significant political actor claims to represent it in the political arena or if the group is experiencing political discrimination.<br>
</p>
<section id="the-dependent-variable-vigilante-activity" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-dependent-variable-vigilante-activity">The dependent variable: Vigilante activity</h2>
<p>Vigilante mobilization is measured using geo-referenced data on conflict events. Data is provided by The Armed Conflict Location &amp; Event Data Project (ACLED), that is generated using news sources, expert and NGO reports on violent and non-violent conflict events worldwide, with a particular focus on Africa.<br>
Conflict events consist of a series of actions realized by one actor or between multiple actors. Contrary to similar data sets, there is not a fatality-based threshold for the inclusion of events, nor do they have to be part of pre-defined modes of organised violence. This approach allows the study to include a broader subset of actions carried out by vigilante groups <span class="citation" data-cites="Raleigh.etal2010">(Raleigh et al. 2010)</span>.&nbsp;Investigating vigilante group presence the analysis will use the ACLED defined actor categories of <em>communal militia</em> or an <em>identity militia</em> which is defined as: “<em>organised around a collective, common feature including community, region, religion or, in exceptional cases, livelihood</em>”. Moreover, ACLED also categorises whether groups can be defined as <em>political militias</em>, thus it is ensured that our signal of the appearance of vigilante groups is not confused with that of militias as descirbed in section on CBAGs.<br>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="state-access">State access</h3>
<p>State access in Africa is closely connected with the state’s ability to physically reach its population. Here the character of a state’s transportation network plays a vital role since it constitutes the foundational infrastructure that permits the state to build and maintain institutions that can ensure social order <span class="citation" data-cites="Muller-Crepon.etal2021">(Müller-Crepon, Hunziker, and Cederman 2021: 568)</span>. Following Müller-Crepon and Müller-Crepon <em>et. al.</em> measuring state accessibility is done based on the average travel time from a country’s capital or regional capitals to individuals inside an ethnic group’s settlement areas. This is calculated using a weighted population average that has the following mathematical form:</p>
<p><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%0Astate%5Cspace%20access_g%20=%20ln%5Cbigg(%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7BI_g%7D%5Csum_%7Bi=1%7D%5E%7BI_g%7D1+time_C,_i%5Cbigg)%0A"></p>
<p>Here <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?time_C,_i"> denotes the travelling time from the country or regional capital, <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?C">, to an individual <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?i"> using the shortest possible path. <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?I_g"> enumerates individuals belonging to an ethnic settlement area (<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?g">), constituting the population weight used in the formula. Using a population-weighted mean ensures that the travelling time to more densely populated areas is weighted higher than that of sparsely populated ones. I log transform the measure, since it better captures the convex relationship between the capacity of the state to assert itself in an area and travelling time <span class="citation" data-cites="Muller-Crepon2021">(Müller-Crepon 2021: 2)</span>. To compute the formula gridded raster data on travelling times and population counts are used together with EPR polygons to devise the final measure. Data on travelling time is provided by Müller-Crepon, who uses digitised footpaths and road networks of Africa to estimate the travelling time from a given grid-cell to either the national or regional capital per year. The approach is similar to Google maps and considers the condition of roads when estimating travelling time <span class="citation" data-cites="Muller-Crepon2021">(Müller-Crepon 2021)</span>. The main advantage of this data source is the time scale of the data, as it allows us to investigate the within variation in our independent variable. Population data is provided by the WorldPop project that, through the use of UN population census data and covariates, is combined in a machine learning model so to be able to accurately estimate the number of people living inside an ethnic group’s settlement area <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?I_g"> and the approximate location of individual group members <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?i"> per year <span class="citation" data-cites="WorldPop2018">(WorldPop 2018)</span>. The thesis opts for the unconstrained version of the dataset that does not take into consideration settlement patterns when estimating population counts, as the accuracy of these data sources has been found to vary through time and between spatial units, thereby limiting the comparative potential of the analysis <span class="citation" data-cites="Stevens.etal2015">(Stevens et al. 2015)</span>.<br>
The final measure based on travelling time from the national capital ranges from -0.58 to 4.12, where higher values indicate an increase in the mean travelling time to members of an ethnic group on a log scale.</p>

<section id="security-environment" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="security-environment">Security environment</h3>
<p>Measuring the security environment in which ethnic groups reside in, the number of violent encounters in neighbouring ethnic areas are used. Using ACLED data, a subset of violent encounters are chosen based on whether rebels, militias or other vigilante groups are involved in violence or one-sided violence against government forces, civilians or between the before mentioned groups. These encounters are chosen as research has highlighted that vigilante groups have, in a number of cases, been mobilised as a response to the activity level of these groups <span class="citation" data-cites="Zech2016 Peic2021 Jentzsch2022">(Zech 2016; Peic 2021; Jentzsch 2022)</span>. The number of violent encounters in neighbouring ethnic areas are applied, so to create a spatial lag of the average threat level in neighbouring ethnic groups’ settlement area, thereby capturing the potential for aggression towards a given ethnic group. The spatial-lag is given by the following formula, where <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?N_g"> is the number of neighbouring ethnic groups and <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?activity_n"> is the activity level in each of the neighbouring areas (<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?n">).</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="ability-to-conduct-collective-action">Ability to conduct collective action</h2>
<p>To gauge whether the community attributes, rules and norms relating to a given ethnic group, data on ethnic groups’ traditional governance structures in Africa is applied. This data source originates from a web survey where a diverse set of experts on ethnic groups were asked to answer a series of questions about the group of their expertise. The questions revolve around the internal institutional structure of an ethnic group and their level of centralization, as well as their formal and informal interactions with state institutions.</p>
<section id="attributes-of-community-1" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="attributes-of-community-1">Attributes of Community</h3>
<p>Measuring whether ethnic groups have an institutional setting that can act as an organisational focal point to disperse information between members, the following collective decision-making bodies have been chosen:</p>
<ul>
<li>Council of elders</li>
<li>Customary assembly</li>
<li>Level of customary institution</li>
</ul>
<p>When it comes to the existence of cooperative arrangements between individuals in ethnic communities, the following unofficial and official functions of traditional organisations are chosen:</p>
<ul>
<li>Land administration</li>
<li>Natural resource management</li>
<li>Security matters, peace and order</li>
<li>Dispute resolution</li>
<li>Infrastructural provisions</li>

<section id="biophysical-material-conditions-1" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="biophysical-material-conditions-1">Biophysical/ Material Conditions</h3>
<p>The biophysical/material conditions of an ethnic community are measured using two measures.<br>
Firstly, when measuring the spatial dispersion of a group, this study follows the proposed method by Weidmann of how to calculate the degree that members of an ethnic group is dispersed. The central measure is denoted “<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?D">” where higher values correspond to more dispersed groups, and is calculated using the below formula:</p>
<p><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%0A%20%20%20%20D=%20%5Cfrac%7B%5Cunderset%7Bi,j%20%5Cin%5C%7B1..N%5C%7D,%20i%20%3C%20j%7D%7B%5Csum%20p(c_i)%20p(c_j)%20log(d(c_i,c_j))%7D%7D%7B%5Cunderset%7Bi,j%20%5Cin%5C%7B1..N%5C%7D,%20i%20%3C%20j%7D%7B%5Csum%20p(c_i)%20p(c_j)%7D%7D%0A"></p>
<p>Using gridded population data from the WorldPop project, the formula uses the number of people inside each settlement cluster, denoted “<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?P(C_n)">” and the logged minimal geodesic distance between each cluster “<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?d(%E2%80%A6)">”. By computing a population-weighted average of the logged minimal geodesic distances between clusters, a measure is created where the distance between heavily populated clusters is weighted higher than that of sparsely populated ones <span class="citation" data-cites="Weidmann2009">(Weidmann 2009: 536)</span>. The measure ranges from 0 to 6.31, where lower values indicate that ethnic groups are more centralised, whereas higher values indicates more dispersed ethnic groups.</p>
<p>The second measure captures to what extent an ethnic group is cultivating their land using irrigation techniques. The measure is devised using satellite data from <em>The Copernicus Climate Change Service</em> (CCI) on land use and population data from the WorldPop project. The land use data is generated using an algorithm that applies different satellites and machine learning classification techniques so to be able to generate yearly assessments of what a given grid-cell of land is being used for. Importantly for this study, the data records whether a grid-cell is classified as “<em>Cropland, irrigated or post-flooding</em>”, indicating if irrigation is used as the primary cultivating technique in an area <span class="citation" data-cites="ESA2017">(ESA 2017)</span>. The final measure is created by combining land use data, ethnic settlement areas and WorldPop population data, enabling the study to calculate the percentage of an ethnic group’s members living in cropland areas being irrigated. Moreover, as it is not affected by the dependent variable i.e.&nbsp;conflict related violence, it is ensured that the measure does not induce a systematic bias in the final results <span class="citation" data-cites="Schultz.Mankin2019">(Schultz and Mankin 2019)</span>. The scale of the measure ranges from 0% to 100% where higher values indicate that a larger share of members of an ethnic group living in areas being irrigated.</p>

<section id="designing-the-statistical-model" class="level1">
<h1>Designing the statistical model</h1>
<p>The final data set consists of repeated counts of vigilante group activity in 196 ethnic groups within 37 African states from 2000 to 2016, resulting in 3009 group years. Working with count data, which show signs of overdispersion<sup>1</sup>, the analysis opt for a negative binomial probability distribution. Thus, I employ a negative binomial regression model that in its standard form can be seen bellow, where <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cmu"> is the mean, <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Calpha"> is the dispersion parameter, <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?X%5ET"> is a matrix of observations and their corresponding values on the variables used in the final model, and <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cbeta"> is a vector of coefficient derived using maximum likelihood estimation. The NB1 parameterization is utilized to account for overdispersion. The NB1 parameterization assumes a linear relationship between the mean and variance of the outcome, as shown in the variance equation.</p>
<p><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%0A%5Cbegin%7Baligned%7D%0AY_i%20%5Csim%20NB(%5Cmu_i,%20%5Calpha)%20%5C%5C%0Alog(%5Cmu_i)%20=%20X%5ET_i%20%5Cbeta%20%5C%5C%0Avar(Y_i)%20=%20%5Cmu_i+%5Calpha%5Cmu_i%0A%5Cend%7Baligned%7D%0A"></p>
<p>Furthermore, the data structure allows the study to investigate the relationship using a hybrid-multilevel regression model that applies the causal identification strategy found in fixed-effects models while at the same time being able to take into account the nested structure of ethnic groups within countries <span class="citation" data-cites="Bell.etal2019 Allison2005 Hamaker.Muthén2020 Morgan2013">(Bell, Fairbrother, and Jones 2019; Allison 2005: 32; Hamaker and Muthén 2020; Morgan 2013: 118)</span>. Central to this model is the decomposing of time-varying predictors into two parts; one representing the between-group variation, whereas the other representing the within-group variation. The between-group estimate is the specific mean for group <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?i"> on the time-varying predictors, which is denoted as: <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Coverline%7Bx_i%7D">, and captures the average effect between groups. The within estimator is calculated using the demeaned method where the time-varying predictor for group <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?i"> in year <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?t"> is subtracted from the group mean: <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?x_i,_t-%5Coverline%7Bx_i%7D"> . This estimator is akin to the conditional estimator found in fixed-effect models and controls for unobserved time-invariant confounders <span class="citation" data-cites="Allison2005 Morgan2013">(Allison 2005: 33; Morgan 2013: 118)</span>.<br>
</p>
<p>When testing time-varying interaction effects in a hybrid multilevel framework two methods have been proposed. Firstly, Schunck argues that the product term between the dependent variable and the interaction variable for group <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?i"> in year <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?t">: <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?x_i,_tz_i,_t"> should as the main predictors, be decomposed into a between estimator, <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Coverline%7Bx_iz_i%7D">, and a within estimator: <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?x_i,_tz_i,_t-%5Coverline%7Bx_iz_i%7D"> <span class="citation" data-cites="Schunck2013">(Schunck 2013)</span>.<br>
Opposite to Schunk’s approach, Giesselmann and Schmidt-Catran argue that this method will do fine when only the dependent variable is time-varying, but when the interaction term is also time-varying unobserved time-invariant confounders are not controlled for, thus the final estimate will be biased. To obtain an unbiased interaction term, they propose the double demean method where one takes the product between the two demeaned terms: <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?(x_i,_t-%5Coverline%7Bx_i%7D)(z_i,_t-%5Coverline%7Bz_i%7D)">. This product term should when be decomposed into a between term, <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Coverline%7B(x_i,_t-%5Coverline%7Bx_i%7D)(z_i,_t-%5Coverline%7Bz_i%7D)%7D">, and a within component that controls for unobserved time-invariant confounders: <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?(x_i,_t-%5Coverline%7Bx_i%7D)(z_i,_t-%5Coverline%7Bz_i%7D)-%5Coverline%7B(x_i,_t-%5Coverline%7Bx_i%7D)(z_i,_t-%5Coverline%7Bz_i%7D)%7D"> <span class="citation" data-cites="Giesselmann.Schmidt-Catran2022">(Giesselmann and Schmidt-Catran 2022)</span>.<br>
Based on the above, the analysis will rely on the double demeaned method, though as a sensitivity analysis the Schunck method will also be used.</p>
<p>The within estimator will not be able to control for time-varying confounders. As a result, omitted variable bias will be introduced in the analysis. In order to account for that, a series of time-varying confounders on both the group and state level are included in the analysis.<br>
On the group level, the logged total population of an ethnic group is included, as it can be expected that more populous groups would be more able to mobilise vigilante groups since they have a larger pool of potential recruits that can be enrolled <span class="citation" data-cites="Neupert-Wentz2020">(Neupert-Wentz 2020)</span>. Furthermore, it would seem reasonable to expect that areas, where more people are located are also the areas that will be prioritised by governmental infrastructural developers when considering the location of new roads. Thus, more populous areas are expected to have more developed road networks <span class="citation" data-cites="Burrier2019">(Burrier 2019)</span>.<br>
Three other confounders are controlled for on the state level. Firstly, GDP per capita adjusted for inflation is included as it has been found to affect both vigilante mobilisation, road infrastructure and violence levels <span class="citation" data-cites="Dao2008 Peic2021 Collier.Hoeffler2004 Fearon.Laitin2003">(Dao 2008; Peic 2021; Collier and Hoeffler 2004; Fearon and Laitin 2003)</span>. Secondly, more democratic states are expected to affect vigilante mobilisation and violence in neighbouring ethnic areas through lower levels of violence inside a state’s borders, which is opposite to autocratic states, which are generally connected with higher levels of violence <span class="citation" data-cites="Krishnarajan.etal2017">(Krishnarajan et al. 2017)</span>. Measuring the level of democracy is done using the V-dem egalitarian democracy index. The index captures whether a state can be considered an electoral democracy and, moreover, if resources and power are distributed eq”“ually among groups <span class="citation" data-cites="Coppedge2021">(Coppedge 2021)</span>. Thirdly, to account for the general conflict level in a state, a binary measure of whether there is ongoing conflict within a state is provided by the UCDP armed conflict database <span class="citation" data-cites="Sundberg.Melander2013">(Sundberg and Melander 2013)</span>. Its inclusion ensures that the effect on vigilante mobilisation is not a response to the general security situation in the state, as it seems reasonable that both violence in neighbouring ethnic areas and road infrastructure are affected by the overall conflict level in a state.

<p>Before turning to the result of the analysis I will briefly highlight three key points. The estimated effects are presented on a multiplicative scale by converting them to <em>Incidence Ratio Rates</em> (IRR) using the exponent of the estimates (<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?e%5E%5Cbeta">) and on an additive scale by calculating the <em>Average Marginal Effect</em> (AME) <span class="citation" data-cites="Hoffmann2016 Buis2010">(Hoffmann 2016: 137-138; Buis 2010)</span>. In all models, confounders are included.<br>
The between estimator is denoted “<em>M</em>” and the within estimator is denoted “<em>DM</em>”. The analysis will primarily focus on the within estimators as they are less affected by omitted variable bias. However, the between effect should not be discarded as it illuminates on average, how much does ethnic groups differ on the same independent variable. Thereby, allowing the thesis to understand the contextual effects of the independent variables, for instance, the effect of groups being situated in general more hostile security environments <span class="citation" data-cites="Bell.etal2019 Hamaker.Muthén2020 Howard2015">(Bell, Fairbrother, and Jones 2019; Hamaker and Muthén 2020; Howard 2015)</span>.<br>
As the estimation of confidence intervals in non-linear multilevel models rests on a series of assumptions, which are commonly violated due to the complex structure of the model <span class="citation" data-cites="Thai.etal2014 Meijler.etal1998">(Thai et al. 2014; Meijler, Bausing, and Leeden 1998)</span>, confidence intervals are derived using parametric bootstrapping with 500 iterations.\</p>
<p>The statistical result can be seen in table 2. Firslty, it is worth noting that in all three models, the estimate of a yearly increase from 2000 to 2016 is associated with a significant positive effect on vigilante activity. In model 3, which controls for both for the main independent variables and confounders, a yearly increase in the studied period is associated with an increase in the IRR of 1.12 or an AME of 15% in expected vigilante group activity. This result indicates that throughout the studied period, vigilante groups have become more active on the African continent.<br>
Turning to the effect of the state’s ability to be present in ethnic settlement areas investigated in model 1, both the between and the within estimates have a positive effect. This indicates that when the mean travelling time from the state capital to members of an ethnic group increases, vigilante groups become more active. Though, only the between estimate is significantly different from zero. As a result, the analysis is only able to establish that there are signs of a significant positive difference of 1.030 in the expected log count of vigilante activity. This effect corresponds to an IRR increase by a factor of 2.801 and an AME of 141% when moving from ethnic groups where on average the state easily can assert itself to groups located in areas that are less accessible. The confidence interval for the effect ranges from 0.36 to 1.67 on a log-scale, which is quite substantial. Though, as noted above, this estimate does not control for unobserved time-invariant confounders on the group level, hence we are unable to ensure that this relationship is not spurious.<br>
A possible explanation for the difference between the between estimate and the within estimate could possibly be due to the short time frame of the study. Because of the slow construction time associated with infrastructure projects, sufficient variation in the within estimate cannot be established.<br>
</p>
<p>Secondly, looking at model 1, it becomes apparent that both the between and the within estimates of a change in security environments becoming more insecure has a significant positive effect on the activity level of vigilante groups. Thereby, a unit increase in the mean activity level of neighboring conflict actors, is associated with an increase of 0.002 in the expected difference in the logs of the expected activity level of vigilante groups, while holding the other variables in the model constant. Using IRR it becomes evident that this effect is akin to a 1.002 factor increase in vigilante activity or an AME of 0.3%, which is a small effect. The confidence interval attests that the within effect is borderline significant.<br>

<p>Together with the within change for each group in the study period, the effect of a unit increase in the security environment on predicted vigilante activity is depicted in figure 3. Lastly, model 3 investigates whether the inclusion of both predictors alters the above result, which is not the case.<br>
The analysis of of whether the effects of the state access and the security environment are conditioned on ethnic communities’ ability to conduct collective action and biophysical/material conditions appear in table 3. Together with the interaction terms, the constitutive terms and confounders are also included in all models.</p>

<p>Looking at model 4 and 7, which explore the conditioning effect of collective institutions, it becomes evident that it is only the effect of state access that is significantly conditioned on ethnic groups having institutions that facilitate collective action (model 4). However, the effect of the interaction term, <em>SADM X Collective institution</em>, runs counter to the theoretical expectation. Because the effect of state access on vigilante activity decreases with -3.682 on a log scale equivalent to an IRR of 0.025 or a 97% decrease with a unit increase on the collective institution measure. The confidence interval for the effect is estimated to be between -7.06 and -0.77 on a log-scale. Indicating, that collective institutions have a hampering effect on communities’ ability to mobilize vigilante groups. This is a perplexing finding that illuminates that locale institutions affect collective action, though more work is needed in order to understand which parts of an institution and how they affect collective action.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>Turning to the effect of the biophysical/material indicators investigated in models 5 to 9, we see again that only the effect of state access is affected significantly. The interaction term <em>SADM X Irrigated pop DM</em> measures how the within effect of state access changes with a within change in the share of people living in irrigated areas. The interaction term is negative and statistically significant. This relationship is modelled in model 5, which estimates that a 1% increase in the share of ethnic members living in irrigated areas is associated with a -33.99 decrease in the effect of state access on expected vigilante group activity on a log-scale. The effect is estimated to range from -54.58 to -22.98 on a log-scale, and corresponds to an IRR of <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?0.2%5E%7B10%5E%7B-16%7D%7D"> or an AME of -52.8%. Thereby being a substantial effect.<br>
The effect is depicted in figure 5, which shows the estimated level of vigilante group activity with a change in state access conditioned on whether 0%, 1% or 2% of members of an ethnic group live in irrigated areas. Despite the large confidence interval, it becomes clear that only groups who do not live in areas being irrigated will mobilise vigilante groups when the state is absent. This finding goes against the theoretical expectation, which might be due to the fact that the irrigation measure is instead capturing another phenomenon, such as the degree of land inequality and locale authoritarianism <span class="citation" data-cites="Bentzen.etal2012">(Bentzen, Kaarsen, and Wingender 2012)</span>, the degree of institutionalism in an area <span class="citation" data-cites="Asrat.Anteneh2019">(Asrat and Anteneh 2019)</span> or drought in an area. Though it is unclear how these variables would affect vigilante group mobilisation.<br>
Regarding the interaction effect between population dispersion and the two independent variables investigated in model 6 and 9, the conditioning effect is estimated to have a positive effect on state access and a negative impact on the effect of the security environment. However, both effects are statistically insignificant.</p>

<p>In order to test whether the findings in the analysis are affected by reporting bias and to understand if the analytical choices made regarding model specification and operationalisation are sensitive to a change in configuration, the study conducts a series of sensitivity analyses.<br>
Firstly, table 4 shows three hybrid-multilevel logistic regression models fitted to the same data set as the analysis, but where the dependent variable has been dichotomised so that it only measures whether vigilante groups are not present or present in a given year.<br>
Similar to model 2 in table 3, we see that the positive but non-significant effect of an increase in the mean travel time from the capital to ethnic settlement areas is still valid in model 10, as a one unit increase is associated with a positive increase in the probability of vigilante groups appearing. Moreover, looking at model 11, it becomes apparent that here too there is a positive but a significant effect of the security environment becoming more hostile.<br>
Testing if reporting bias affects the interaction hypothesis, table 2 in appendix 2 investigates whether the findings in table 4 in the analysis change when using the dichotomised dependent variable. Here we see that the interaction effects <em>SADM X Collective institution</em> and <em>SADM X Irrigated pop DM</em> both become insignificant, indicating that reporting bias might be affecting this area of the analysis. It could be argued that the above result is instead a product of the change in functional form from a negative binomial to a logistic form. In order to assess whether that is the case, four specification curve analyses are performed regarding how a change in functional form affects the results relating to the effect of state presence and the security environment and the two before mentioned interaction terms. In these analyses, different regression models are fitted to the original dataset using the following four functional forms:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Hybrid-multilevel model using a Poisson distribution (<em>ML poisson</em>)</li>
<li>Hybrid-multilevel model using a Negative Ninomial distribution (<em>ML negative binomial</em>)</li>
<li>Linear hybrid-multilevel model where vigilante group activity is on a log-scale (<em>ML linear (log)</em>)</li>
<li>A three-way linear fixed effect model where vigilante group activity is on a log-scale (<em>FE linear (log)</em>)</li>
</ol>
<p>Besides varying the functional form, the analyses also investigate how changing which confounders are included affects the result. Only the models where all confounders are included will be considered in this section.<br>
Figure 4.A1 depicts the specification curve relating to the effect of a change in the security environment, and the interaction hypothesis <em>SADM X Irrigated pop DM</em> is shown in figure 4.A2.<br>
Looking at plot 6.A1, we see that changing the functional form of the model only has a limited effect on the final results regarding the effect of the security environment since all models estimate the within effect to be between 0.0021 and 0.0031 on a log-scale, and be significantly different from zero.<br>
</p>

<p>A different pattern emerges when it comes to the within effect of state access, which is depicted in figure 1 in appendix 2. Here both ML negative binomial and FE linear (log) estimates an insignificant effect of 0.2, whereas ML Poisson and ML linear (log) estimate a significant effect spanning from 0.2 to 4. Moreover, changing the state access measure to one where transport time is calculated from the regional capital (SADM (regional)) instead of the national capital also has a major impact on the final result, as all models with the exception of the FE linear (log) estimates a significant effect ranging from 0.3 to 4.9. Thereby, lending support to hypothesis 1.<br>
Moving to plot A2 in figure 4, depicting a specification curve for the interaction term <em>SADM X Irrigated pop DM</em> two surprising results becomes apparent. Firstly, the choice of functional form has a noteworthy effect on the effect size, as the nonlinear models estimate a significant effect ranging from -38.4 to -28.6. In contrast, the linear models estimate it to be around 1, and it is only significant when estimated using ML linear (log). Secondly, it also becomes apparent that how the interaction term is created affects whether the effect of the interaction term becomes negative or positive. When the interaction term is calculated using the double de-meaned method it becomes negative, whereas when using the de-meaned method it becomes positive. A similar effect of the choice of functional form is also seen when it comes to the effect size of the interaction term <em>SADM X Collective institution</em>, which is depicted in figure 2 appendix 2.</p>

<p>The sensitivity analysis shows that the results of the analysis regarding state access and the security environment are not affected by reporting bias. Though there are indications of it affecting the estimation of the interaction hypotheses. However, the method used to assess whether reporting bias is present is not able to discern between if it is reporting bias or the change in the functional form of the statistical model that is affecting the final results. In order to understand whether that is the case, a series of specification curve analyses were conducted, making it possible to assess if a change in the functional form, number of confounders, national or regional capital and how the interaction term is created affects the final results.<br>
Overall, the significant effect of a change in the security environment is the most robust finding in this study. When it comes to the effect of state access, changing the functional form has an effect on the estimated size and significance level. Most noteworthy calculating state access using regional capitals instead of only the national ones has a substantial effect on the findings of the analysis. Furthermore, both functional form and how interaction effects are created also have a substantial effect on the findings of this study. Firstly, it indicates that we should be conscious of how to assess interaction hypotheses in linear and nonlinear models. Secondly, these results do not mean that the double de-meaned estimator is a misspecification, actually the opposite as the non-double de-meaned estimator estimates a positive effect, which conflicts with the graphical representation in figure 5.</p>

<h1>Conclusion</h1>
<p>This analysis has tried to understand what determines the activity level of vigilante groups across the African continent. To the author’s knowledge, a similar study in relation to the number of cases and time frame of this phenomenon has not been conducted before.<br>
Understanding this actor is important as vigilante groups have increasingly become an important supplier of security in African security markets, especially in areas of failed states. Despite this, comparative research regarding this actor is sparse. Moreover, research has a tendency to lump vigilante groups together with militias and view vigilante groups as governments’ extended arm used for the projection of state power.<br>
Therefore, this thesis has based on litterateur on vigilante groups and militias developed a definition of vigilante groups being mobilised from the bottom-up, and not being interested in revolutionary change or government takeover, but instead in security.</p>
<p>Two hypotheses relating to the effect of the state’s presence and the security environment on vigilante group appearance have been developed. Moreover, it is theorised that as vigilante groups are mobilised from the bottom-up, the effect of the two proposed hypotheses is conditioned on whether locale communities are able to overcome the collective action problem, and, thereof be successful in mobilising vigilante groups.<br>
Using Ostrom’s and colleagues’ IAD framework together with theories on collective action, a novel measure of communities’ ability to overcome the collective action problem has been derived. It focuses on how attributes and the rules of communities, and the biophysical/material environment in which they are situated in, jointly constitute a latent variable determining communities’ ability to perform collective action. An important benefit of using a multi-dimensional measure, is that it does not focus on a single attribute as being the decisive component fostering collective action in communities but instead views it as a multifaceted phenomenon where different attributes through different mechanisms increase the likelihood that members of a community will work together instead of free-riding.<br>
</p>
<p>Ethnic settlement areas are applied as the main unit of analysis, thereby more accurately representing the theoretical mechanisms. Data sources relating to vigilante activity level, transportation time, population counts, satellite data on land use, and traditional institutions are combined with ethnic settlement areas to create a unique locale data set.<br>
Applying this data set, the empirical validity of the proposed measure of communities’ ability to conduct collective action is tested using CFA. The analysis rejects the existence of a single latent dimension shared by all the measures, as the biophysical/material measures do not capture the same dimension as the other measures. Instead, the study uncovers that the measures related to community attributes and customary rules are all manifestations of the same latent variable, and therefore are used to create a measure denoted collective institutions.<br>
The biophysical/material measures relating to how agricultural practises, in the form of irrigation, nurture cooperation, and population dispersion, are moreover found to each be measuring their own unique phenomena.<br>
The results of this analysis constitute an important starting point on how comparative research can develop more encompassing measures of how the structures, both social and natural, of ethnic communities either foster or hamper collective action, instead of just relying on single attributes. However, more research is needed in this area in order to fully understand the nature of this phenomenon.</p>
<p>The hypotheses are tested using a longitudinal hybrid-multilevel regression model. A core advantage of this model is that it allows the thesis to control for unobserved time-invariant confounders while at the same time taking into account how ethnic groups are nested within countries. This approach thereby ensures the causal validity of the estimates in the analysis.<br>
Investigating the effect of the state’s ability to access territory and thereby be active in the market for security, the analysis fails to establish a significant causal link. Indicating that when the state is unable to provide security in an area, civilians will not, as a response, begin to provide for their own security by the formation of vigilante groups. Although there are signs of a significant and positive effect when comparing ethnic groups’ mean level across the studied period. Furthermore, when using regional capitals instead of national ones in the calculation of state access, a significant causal effect is established. A possible reason for these mixed result, could be due to the short period analysed, which limits the amount of variation needed.<br>
Opposite to the effect of state access, a significant and positive effect of security environments becoming more hostile is established. Thereby, when civilians find themselves in more insecure security markets, they are more likely to establish vigilante groups to provide for their own security. Thereby stipulating that civilians do not just choose non-violent tactics when responding to insecurity and threats, but will actively opt for violent ones as a way to cope with hostile security environments. Indicating civilian agency in violent conflicts. Though, the effect is fairly small and borderline significant.</p>
<p>Exploring if the effects of state access and the security environment are conditioned on ethnic communities’ collective institutions and the biophysical/material environment they reside in, the analysis finds that it is only the effect of state access that significantly is being altered. Though the effects run counter the theoretical expectations. Because the analysis exposes that communities characterised by having strong collective institutions characterised by cooperation and rules fostering collective action will significantly be less likely to mobilise vigilante groups when state access diminishes. The same trend is also present when it comes to the biophysical/material measure of how the agricultural practice of irrigation affects vigilante mobilisation. These results are perplexing, and highlights the need for more research relating to both collective action and the collective act of mobilising vigilante groups.</p>
<p>A series of sensitivity analyses were performed, in order to understand if the results obtained from the analysis are robust to the different analytical choices made in the analysis. Most noteworthy is that the estimated effect size and significant level of the interaction terms are very volatile to a change in the functional form of the statistical model and the method used to calculate such terms. For this reason one should be careful when interpreting the results of the conditioning effect of communities ability to conduct collective action. This finding calls for closer scrutiny of the debated issue of how to include interaction effects in especially nonlinear statistical models.</p>
<p>Lastly, the study has uncovered that an unknown time varying variable has a substantial and significant effect on the emergence of vigilante groups. Because a yearly increase from the beginning of studied period to its end, is strongly related to an increase in vigilante group activity. Highlighting that more research is needed to uncover what is driving this trend.</p>
<p>Winding up, this analysis has come closer to understanding in which contexts vigilante groups will appear and how active they will be. There is however, still unexplored areas related not only to what drives vigilante group mobilisation, but also how they affect conflicts and civilian casualties. Because will the presence of vigilante groups prolong conflicts as they are essentially a sign that civil society has become militarised? <span class="citation" data-cites="Osorio.etal2021">(Osorio, Schubiger, and Weintraub 2021)</span>. Moreover, will their embeddedness in communities due to their bottom-up mobilisation mean that they will be less hostile towards civilians, which evidence from Afghanistan indicates <span class="citation" data-cites="Dearing2021">(Dearing 2021: 15)</span>, or will they be used to oppress for instance sub-ethnic groups?</p>

<li id="fn1"><p>Overdispersion occurs when the variance of count data exceeds its mean, violating the Poisson distribution’s assumption of equal mean and variance. This phenomenon often results from unobserved heterogeneity, data clustering, or excess zeros. Ignoring overdispersion can lead to underestimated standard errors and inflated test statistics, potentially causing false positive results. Negative binomial regression is a common approach to address overdispersion in count data analysis.↩︎</p></li>
