    "text": "When installing solar panels on a flat roof, one of the most important factors to consider is the spacing between rows of panels. This is to ensure that the shadow cast by one row does not fall on the row behind it, which would reduce efficiency. In this post, I will show how to use R to calculate the length of the shadow cast by solar panels and, therefore, the required spacing between the rows.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe first calculation we need to perform is the horizontal length of the solar panel, which depends on the panel’s tilt angle. The formula for the horizontal projection of a panel can be derived from basic trigonometry. Firstly, we need to find the side \\(b\\) of the triangle, which can be done using the following relationship:\n\\[\ncos(A)=\\frac{b}{c}\n\\] where: - \\(( A )\\) is the tilt angle of the panel. - \\(( b )\\) is the horizontal length of the panel. - \\(( c )\\) is the height of the panel.\nWhen isolating \\(b\\) we get: \\[\ncos(A)c=b\n\\]\nIn this example, the height of the panel \\(( c )\\) is 1.1 meters, and the tilt angle \\(( A )\\) is \\(( 13^\\circ )\\). The following R code calculates the horizontal length (note that we convert degrees to radians):\n\n# Calculate the horizontal length of the panel\np_l &lt;- 1.1 * cos(13 * pi / 180)\np_l  # Display the horizontal length in meters\n\n[1] 1.071807\n\n\n\n\n\nNext, we calculate the shadow length \\((d)\\) cast by the panel, which depends on the angle of the sun \\((\\beta)\\) and the panel’s vertical height:\n\\[\nd = \\frac{a}{tan(\\beta)}\n\\]\nWhere:\n\n\\((a)\\) is the vertical height of the panel, adjusted by the sine of the tilt angle.\n\\((\\beta)\\) is the angle of the sun.\n\nUsing the property \\(a=sin⁡(A)\\), we substitute:\n\\[\n= \\frac{sin(A)\\cdot c}{tan(\\beta)}\n\\]\nIn order to find data on the sun angle I use the suncalc package. Here’s how to do it in R:\n\n\n\nlibrary(suncalc)\nlibrary(lubridate)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\n\n\n\n\nHere I use the first day of the month and noon as the time of day:\n\n# Fetch sun's angle (altitude) for each month at noon\nsunALT_df &lt;- getSunlightPosition(\n  date = ymd_hm(\"2024/01/01 12:00\") + months(seq(0, 11)),\n  lat = 55, \n  lon = 12,\n  keep = c(\"altitude\")\n)\n\n# Convert altitude from radians to degrees\nsunALT_df$altitude_deg &lt;- sunALT_df$altitude * (180 / pi)\nsunALT_df  # Display sun angle data\n\n                  date lat lon  altitude altitude_deg\n1  2024-01-01 12:00:00  55  12 0.1984576     11.37078\n2  2024-02-01 12:00:00  55  12 0.3029835     17.35968\n3  2024-03-01 12:00:00  55  12 0.4733542     27.12120\n4  2024-04-01 12:00:00  55  12 0.6791656     38.91332\n5  2024-05-01 12:00:00  55  12 0.8552644     49.00304\n6  2024-06-01 12:00:00  55  12 0.9740378     55.80826\n7  2024-07-01 12:00:00  55  12 0.9958690     57.05909\n8  2024-08-01 12:00:00  55  12 0.9091945     52.09300\n9  2024-09-01 12:00:00  55  12 0.7364647     42.19632\n10 2024-10-01 12:00:00  55  12 0.5315600     30.45614\n11 2024-11-01 12:00:00  55  12 0.3341991     19.14820\n12 2024-12-01 12:00:00  55  12 0.2117176     12.13053\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow, we can calculate the shadow length for each month based on the sun’s angle and the height of the panel.\n\n# Calculate the vertical height of the panel\na &lt;- 1.1 * sin(13 * pi / 180)\n\n# Calculate the shadow length for each month\nd &lt;- a / tan(sunALT_df$altitude)\nd  # Display shadow lengths\n\n [1] 1.2304344 0.7915535 0.4831113 0.3065175 0.2150786 0.1681121 0.1603308\n [8] 0.1926801 0.2729304 0.4208164 0.7126426 1.1512404\n\n\n\n\n\nFinally, we add the panel’s horizontal length to the shadow length to get the total spacing required for each row of panels. We can visualize this spacing for each month of the year using a bar plot.\n\n# Calculate total required row spacing\ntot_w &lt;- d + p_l\nw_df &lt;- data.frame(total_width = tot_w, month = sunALT_df$date)\n\n# Calculate row spacing for 3 and 4 rows\nrow3 &lt;- (7.27 - p_l) / 3\nrow4 &lt;- (7.27 - p_l) / 4\n\n# Plot the required row spacing for each month\nggplot(data = w_df, aes(x = as.Date(month), y = total_width)) + \n  geom_bar(stat = \"identity\", width = 0.1, color = \"blue\") + \n  geom_point() + \n  geom_hline(yintercept = c(row3, row4), linetype = \"dashed\") + \n  scale_x_date(date_labels = \"%b\", date_breaks = \"1 month\") + \n  labs(x = \"Month\", y = \"Total Row Spacing (meters)\") + \n  theme_bw()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the plot, the dashed lines represent the spacing for 3 rows and 4 rows, allowing you to see how the shadow length changes throughout the year and how it affects the required spacing.\nBy following these steps, you can calculate the optimal row spacing for solar panels to avoid shading, ensuring maximum energy efficiency throughout the year."

    "text": "For 25 years, the terrorist organisation al-Shabaab has wrought a reign of terror over Somalia, destabilising the country, terrorising communities, and hampering growth and stability. The organisation gained momentum after the Ethiopian-led invasion of Somalia in 2006, when the parent organisation of al-Shabaab, Islamic Courts Union, was ousted from Mogadishu (Mengisteab 2013: 138-139). In the following years, al-Shabaab asserted itself by controlling large parts of central and southern Somalia, including the capital Mogadishu, and the port city of Kismayo, subsequently forming a quasi-government in these areas (Bacon and Muibu 2019; polgeonow.com 2012). However things changed in 2011 when the Transnational Federal Government of Somalia and the African Union led multinational military force, AMISOM, wrested a significant amount of territory from al-Shabaab, including Mogadishu and Kismayo. This resulted in al-Shabaab only controlling mostly rural areas and was forced to revert to its insurgency roots (Gaid 2022).\nAl-Shabab’s control of these areas has since 2012 mostly been unchallenged. From mid-2022 al-Shabaab was again facing threats to its territorial control. Because a coalition between Somali state forces and a selection of Somali clan militias initiated an offensive against the group. The presence of the clan militias has according to some analysts been a sign of a popular uprising against al-Shabaab (Africa Confidential 2022; Nor 2022).\nWith the launch of the second phase of the offensive in March last year, which by now seemed to be stalled (Valmary 2023; Crisis group 2023), and the planned withdrawal of African Union military forces from Somalia at the end of this year (Stares 2024), it is necessary that we take a look at the current state of this conflict.\nThe analysis will use a series of different quantitative data sources and advanced machine learning and statistical methods in order to establish where the offensive has been taking place, and the subsequent character and placement of the reprisal attacks by al-Shabaab. Moreover, the analysis will also seek to assess whether the offensive has changed the size of the land controlled by al-Shabaab, and understand which actors are most prominent in the fight against al-Shabaab.\nThe period being covered stretches from the first of August 2022 to the end of October 2023. Methodological and analytical decisions are briefly discussed throughout the document, and the related R-code for each section is also attached."

    "text": "The location of the fight against al-Shabaab and the groups fighting al-Shabaab\nLooking at the map bellow (figure 1), which depicts the position and number of casualties of attacks and strategic developments against al-Shabaab in the analysed period, we see that the vast majority of such activities are taking place in the Hiraan (19%), Galgaduud (14%), Middle (17%) and Lower Shabelle (11%) regions. A majority of these activities against al-Shabaab are either armed clashes with the group or violent seizure of the group’s territory by Somali government forces. These activities in the Hiraan region resulted in 758 causalities, whereas in the Middle and Lower Shabelle they resulted in a total of 1924 causalities. However, another major activity is the non-violent seizure of al-Shabaab territory by government forces, which corroborates reports that al-Shabaab forces have reverted to their previous tactic of withdrawal without confrontation, a tactic they had previously only displayed when confronted by AU forces(Gaid 2022: 32). To a lesser degree than the three before-mentioned regions, the fight against al-Shabaab is also taking place in Galgaduud, Bay, and Lower Juba, where battles and explosions have killed a total of 228 people.\n\n\nCode\n###############################\n######## Generating map of attacks and strategic-\n######## developments against Al-Shabaab\n###############################\n\n### Preparing environment \n\n# Loading libaries\nlibrary(sf)\nlibrary(stars)\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(lubridate)\nlibrary(leaflet)\n\n\n# sf option \nsf_use_s2(FALSE)\n\n\n##########\n## Loading data \n#########\n\n## Loading regional capitals \n# https://spatial.faoswalim.org/layers/geonode:SOM_regional_capitals/metadata_detail\nsomali_cap &lt;- read_sf(\"source-data/regional-cap/SOM_regional_capitals/SOM_regional_capitals.shp\")\n\n## Creating point for the national capital\nnational_cap &lt;- data.frame(\"NAME\" = \"Mogadishu\",\n                           \"Y_COORD\" = 2.0392,\n                           \"X_COORD\" = 45.3419)\n\nnational_cap &lt;- national_cap |&gt;

Nor 2022), a finding that this analysis confirms. Because looking at table table 3, which shows activities against al-Shabaab for different actors per region, it becomes evident that in the Hiraan region, 14.08% of the activities against al-Shabaab were initiated by the Hiraan-based clan militias Macawiisley and Hawadle, though Somali military and special forces still account for 70% of the activities against al-Shabaab in the region. These militia can be categorised as a community-initiated self-defence force, because the group mainly consists of locales who, in the absence of government-sponsored security guarantees, themselves initiate the provision of their own and their community’s security (Ibrahim Shire 2022; Nor 2022; Schuberth 2015). It is not new for members of especially Macawiisley Clan Militia to revolt against al-Shabaab as this group successfully took up arms against al-Shabaab in 2014, owing also to al-Shabaab’s excessive taxation of people in the Hiraan region (Ibrahim Shire 2022: 17). This finding confirms the result of another study of the mobilisation of community-initiated self-defence forces, that such groups are more likely to emerge in a conflict if its members in the past have successfully mobilised self-defence forces (Osorio, Schubiger, and Weintraub, n.d.). A noteworthy difference between the Macawiisley revolt in 2014 and the present one is the duration because the former ended rather quickly due to the lack of government support (Ibrahim Shire 2022). Thus, the current one’s longevity seems to some extent to be a product of the current government’s swift support to the clan militia.\n\nTable 3: Activities against al-Shabaab per regon for different actors\n\n\nCode\n# Casualties per region \ntable_3 &lt;- AS_attacked_df |&gt; \n     group_by(admin1, actor1) |&gt; \n     summarise(n_act = n()) |&gt; \n     ungroup() |&gt; \n     group_by(admin1) |&gt; \n     mutate(frac_act = round((n_act/sum(n_act))*100)) |&gt; \n  rename(\"Region\" = \"admin1\", \"Actor\" = \"actor1\" ,\"Number of activities per region\" = n_act, \"Fraction of activities per region\" = \"frac_act\")\n\n\n`summarise()` has grouped output by 'admin1'.

Shabelle, where it is the Abgal Clan Militia, who, together with Somali security forces, accounts for the majority of activity against al-Shabaab. A reason for the participation of the Abgal clans in the offensive could be because the current president of Somalia, Hassan Shikh Mohamud, himself comes from the Abgal clan. Interestingly, this findings goes against reports of the non-participation of the Abgal clan in the offensive against al-Shabaab (Africa Confidential 2022) .\nTable 3 also reveals the stationary character of clan militias, as their activity level is limited to specific regions, since they are rarely active in other regions than their home region. The only actors who are active across regions are the Somali military forces. This finding highlights a special characteristic of the offensive against al-Shabaab; it is in some ways, dependent on whether government forces can convince local clan militias to take up arms against al-Shabaab, in order for the offensive to move into new regions. It should be noted that in regions such as Bay and Galgaduud it is government forces, which for the most part is leading the fight against al-Shabaab, with minor support from clan militias.\nMoving from the individual regions to the whole of Somalia, figure 2 depicts the number of encounters against al-Shabaab per actor found in the security arena in Somalia. The thickness of the line between an actor and al-Shabaab indicates the number of violent or strategic encounters between the actors. Thereby, the figure allows the analysis to understand which actors are most involved in the fight against al-Shabaab. With 423 encounters with al-Shabaab it becomes clear that throughout the offensive it is SNA who have been leading the fight against al-Shabaab. The organisation has in 1/3 of the time engaged in battles with al-Shabaab and the violent seizure of territory, but 50% of SNA activity against al-Shabaab involves the non-violent seizure of territory from the group. Frequently SNA forces are accompanied by either Macawiisley or Abgal clan militias in different operations, but the militias also often face al-Shabaab themselves, thereby underpinning the active role of clan militias in the offensive.\nLooking at international actors operating in Somalia, in the form of the AU lead ATMIS mission and countries such as Turkey or the USA, it is evident that of all the international actors engaged, the USA’s army is heavily invested in the fight against al-Shabaab. However, these activities is mostly airstrikes or the use of drones. Contrary to this, the other international actors’ engagements in the conflict seems minimal and also when comparing to past offensives against al-Shabaab (Gaid 2022). In total, ATMIS forces had only 34 encounters with al-Shabaab, which for the most part have been the use of remote explosions such as drones or assisting in securing a former al-Shabaab controlled area. Though, ATMIS forces have, in a few instances, fought directly against al-Shabaab or alongside SNA forces when capturing villages from al-Shabaab, in for instance, lower Shabelle.\n\n\nCode\n############\n##### Only attack against AS \n############\n## libraries needed to conduct network analysis \n\nlibrary(tidygraph)\nlibrary(ggraph)\n\n## ACLED from September \nACLED_year &lt;- ACLED_df %&gt;% \n  mutate(event_type = as.factor(event_type),\n         event_date_1 = dmy(event_date)) %&gt;% \n  filter(event_date_1 &gt;= \"2022-08-01\")\n\n### Creating new data base only against AS\nACLED_year_AS &lt;- ACLED_year |&gt;

    "text": "Where and how al-Shabaab has retaliated\nExploring how AS has retaliated, figure 3 shows the location and the number of casualties of al-Shabaab attacks and bombs in Somalia. The majority of the attacks in the studied period took place in administrative region of Banadir, i.e., Mogadishu (25.8%), Lower Shabelle (25.4%), and lower Juba (12,6%). A common trait found among these events are that they are mostly armed attacks against government forces and civilians. Approximately 15% of all events involving AS were directed against civilians, killing around 730 people. In Mogadishu, al-Shabaab has conducted several hit-and-run attacks against military forces and civilians, and conducted suicide bombings in public places, killing a total of 758 people in the city and surrounding areas. Among these attacks was a major suicide attack close to the Somali ministry of education, killing 121 civilians and injuring 300.\nA similar pattern also exists in Lower Shabelle and Lower Juba, though with fewer casualties. Although the activity level of al-Shabaab in the Galgaduud and Hiraan regions is lower than that of other regions, 2046 people have been killed by al-Shabaab in these two regions, making it the regions where most people have been killed by al-Shabaab attacks.\n\nTable 4: al-Shabaab activities per region\n\n\nCode\n### Attacks by AS \nAS_attacks_df &lt;- ACLED_df |&gt;  \n  filter(actor1 == \"Al Shabaab\") |&gt; \n  mutate(event_type = as.factor(event_type),\n         event_date_1 = dmy(event_date)) |&gt; \n  filter(event_date_1 &gt;= \"2022-08-01\")  |&gt;  \n  filter(event_type != \"Strategic developments\") |&gt; # Since we are only looking at attacks\n  mutate(event_type = droplevels(event_type))\n\ntable_4 &lt;- AS_attacks_df |&gt; \n  group_by(admin1) |&gt; \n  summarise(tot_act = n()) |&gt; \n  arrange(desc(tot_act)) |&gt; \n  rename(\"Region\" = \"admin1\", \"Number of activities\" = \"tot_act\")\nknitr::kable(table_4)\n\n\n\n\n\nRegion\nNumber of activities\n\n\n\n\nBanadir\n663\n\n\nLower Shabelle\n652\n\n\nLower Juba\n323\n\n\nBay\n272\n\n\nHiraan\n202\n\n\nMiddle Shabelle\n126\n\n\nBakool\n107\n\n\nGalgaduud\n97\n\n\nGedo\n69\n\n\nMudug\n20\n\n\nMiddle Juba\n16\n\n\nBari\n13\n\n\nSanaag\n6\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 5: al-Shabaab attack fatalities\n\n\nCode\ntable_5 &lt;- AS_attacks_df |&gt; \n  group_by(admin1) |&gt; \n  summarise(tot_fat = sum(fatalities)) |&gt; \n  arrange(desc(tot_fat)) |&gt; \n  rename(\"Region\" = \"admin1\", \"Total fatalities\" = \"tot_fat\")\nknitr::kable(table_5)\n\n\n\n\n\nRegion\nTotal fatalities\n\n\n\n\nGalgaduud\n1147\n\n\nHiraan\n899\n\n\nBanadir\n758\n\n\nLower Shabelle\n698\n\n\nBakool\n590\n\n\nMiddle Shabelle\n561\n\n\nLower Juba\n363\n\n\nBay\n249\n\n\nMudug\n105\n\n\nGedo\n103\n\n\nMiddle Juba\n49\n\n\nBari\n12\n\n\nSanaag\n9\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nAS_attacks_sf &lt;- AS_attacks_df |&gt; \n  mutate_at(vars(longitude, latitude), as.numeric)  |&gt;    # coordinates must be numeric\n  st_as_sf(                                   # Creating a sf object\n    coords= c(\"longitude\", \"latitude\"),\n    agr = \"constant\",\n    crs = st_crs(\"+proj=longlat +datum=WGS84 +no_defs\"), # align coordinate system       \n    stringsAsFactors = FALSE,\n    remove = TRUE\n  )\n\n############################ \n## Creating the map \n############################ \n\n##### Event map \n#### Attacks carried out by al-Shabaab\n# Take the centroid of each multipolygon in labeled_regions\nlabeled_regions_centroid &lt;- st_centroid(somail_reg)\n\n# Convert event_type to factor for proper coloring\nAS_attacks_sf$event_type &lt;- as.factor(AS_attacks_sf$event_type)\n\n# Create a base map\nm &lt;- leaflet() %&gt;%\n  addProviderTiles(\"CartoDB.Positron\")  # You can choose a different tile provider\n\nm &lt;- m |&gt; \n  addCircleMarkers(data = war_fires_sf,\n                   fillOpacity = 0.65,\n                   radius = 1,\n                   color = \"blue\",\n                   popup = ~paste(\"Type: Conflict related fire\", \"&lt;br&gt; Date: \", date))\n\n# Add circles for AS attacks with popups\n\npal &lt;- colorFactor(\n  palette = c(\"#66c2a5\", \"#fc8d62\", \"#8da0cb\"),\n  domain = AS_attacks_sf$event_type)\n\nm &lt;- m %&gt;%\n  addCircleMarkers(data = AS_attacks_sf, \n                   color = ~pal(event_type), \n                   radius = ~sqrt(fatalities) * 1,  # Adjust the multiplier for smaller circles\n                   fillOpacity = 0.65,\n                   popup = ~paste(\"Type: \", event_type, \"&lt;br&gt; Fatalities: \", fatalities, \"&lt;br&gt; Date: \", event_date_1))\n\n# Add polygons for administrative regions\nm &lt;- m %&gt;%\n  addPolygons(data = somail_reg, fill=F, color = \"black\", weight = 0.5, fillOpacity = 0.8)\n\n# Customize the map appearance\nm &lt;- m %&gt;%\n  addLegend(position = \"bottomright\", \n            colors = c(\"#66c2a5\", \"#fc8d62\",\"#8da0cb\", \"blue\"), \n            labels = c(levels(AS_attacks_sf$event_type),\"Conflict related fires\"),\n            opacity = 0.7)\n\n# Display the map\nm\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3 - Attacks by al-Shabaab"

    "text": "Territorial control using a grid of hexagons\nOpposite other analyses of territorial control, which view control as a binary phenomenon between being controlled or not controlled, this analysis operationalizes it as a continuous variable. Hereby, territorial control is understood as a spectrum with two extremes; fully controlled by AS or fully controlled by the Somali government. However, control also falls in between the two extremes since territory, to a varying degree, can be controlled by the two actors or be disputed. This approach is advantageous as it enables the analysis to capture the floating character of territorial control in asymmetrical civil wars such as the one in Somalia.\nTo gauge territorial control the analysis follows Theresa Anders’ approach, where territorial control is firstly operationalised using a hexagonal grid as the spatial unit of interest, where each hexagonal cell spans 0.20 decimal degrees (Anders 2020). Using these spatial units instead of administrative regions allows the analysis to assess territorial control independently of administrative borders.\nSecondly, in order to assess territorial control of a grid cell I apply the following three data sources: 1) Maps of AS-controlled areas in Somalia for August 2022 and September 2022 provided by the Critical Threats Project (Karr, n.d.) to gauge which hexagons are i) fully controlled by AS, ii) partly controlled by AS, and iii) are AS attacks zones. 2) Using a specialized coding scheme each recorded event in the ACLED data set is assigned a unique numerical value depending on the nature of a control-related event and whether it was AS, government forces, or other domestic and international government allies of the government who performed the action. Lower values are associated with AS control whereas higher values with Somali government control. 3) Lastly, the location and time of conflict-related fires are also applied as an indicator of armed attacks, and thereby a sign that an area is contested.\nThe events are then aggregated to the hexagonal cells on a monthly time frame. Territorial control of a grid cell is thus assigned based on the occurrence of a specific event within a cell. New events cause a cell to update the coded level of territorial control based on the event type. In the case of multiple events occurring in the same grid cell month, the analysis averages across them. Cells with no events in a given month are imputed to mirror the control value of the cell in the previous month.\n\nThe final result of the above approach is shown in figure 4 below for southern and central Somalia. This part of Somalia is chosen since it is in these areas that that al-Shabaab controls territory, and figure 1 indicates that the fight against al-Shabaab has for the most part been taking part in these areas.\nWhat becomes evident is that al-Shabaab control has only been significantly reduced in the central regions of Hiiran, Middle Shebelle, and Galgaadud, whereas the group’s control of the southern regions has not changed significantly. This lack of the Somali forces’ ability to capture land in the southern part of the country could be an indicator of the governments’ inability to persuade locale clans to take up arms against al-Shabaab.\nIt also becomes clear that no major changes in territorial control have happen since August of 2023, a sign of the second phase of the offensive has stalled.\n\n\nCode\n###############################\n######## Preparing data for    \n######## territorial map \n###############################\nlibrary(data.table)\nlibrary(wesanderson)\nlibrary(ggrepel)\n\n##########\n## Loading assesed areas\n##########\nas_area_ass &lt;- readRDS(\"source-data/as_assesed_area/as_area_ass.rds\")\n\n##########\n## Loading ACLED data\n##########\n##################### Creation of territorial control data\n### Creating spatial object for events\nACLED_sf &lt;- ACLED_df |&gt;

One could for instance think that the state’s ability to project power and hence control of an area is conditioned on its ability to transport military personnel and equipment to areas within its borders (Scott 1999). To make up for these disadvantages the analysis, besides the monthly grid of territorial control, also uses a spatial interpolation method called Kriging in order to estimate territorial control in Somalia. This geostatistical method uses a limited set of sampled data points to estimate the value of a variable, in our case territorial control, over a continuous spatial field (Gräler, Pebesma, and Heuvelink 2016).\nI will briefly describe my approach: First, a 1 x 1-km raster grid of Southern and Central Somalia is created, where each grid cell contains the following information: i) average transportation time from regional capitals to the grid cell as a measure of state reach (Müller-Crepon, Hunziker, and Cederman 2021), ii) population density (WorldPop, n.d.), and iii) nighttime lights intensity as a proxy for economic development (Elvidge et al. 2017). Hereafter, I extract one point from each hexagon cell in the monthly grid of territorial control described earlier (figure 4) together with the corresponding territorial control value from the cell in question. The centroid of each hexagon is chosen as the point being extracted. This is followed by universal kriging interpolation that uses the location of each point, the corresponding territorial control value, state reach, population density, and nighttime lights, in order to estimate territorial control for each 1 x 1-km grid cell. Thus, achieving a more fine grained assessment where the effect of a pre-defined spatial shape does not affect the final assessment and covariates of interest affecting control are moreover included.\nHowever, this approach comes with a caveat. By using the centroid of each hexagon-cell as the foundation for conducting kriging interpolation we lose spatial accuracy since the point sampled does not reflect the location of the ACLED events and conflict related fires. Though in especially the case where also polygons of al-Shabbab control and attack areas are included in the model, it is necessary to convert the polygons into points, which when compared with the chosen method has the effect that the importance of ACLED events and conflict-related fires are downplayed, thus leading to a misrepresentation of territorial control. This comparative analysis of the two approaches can be attached if needed. Moreover, using the hexagonal-grid ensures that the assessment of areas where no events have occurred in a given month are still included in the analysis due to the hexagonal-grid’s use of past value when inferring the current state of a cell if nothing has happened.\nThe above process is computationally heavy, and because of that I have only performed kriging interpolation for October 2023, i.e., the last month of the studied period. Figure 5 depicts the results using a continuous measure (press drop down arrow to view), whereas the same measurement has been turned into a discrete measure in figure 6 in order to ease interpretation.\n\nCode for univeral kriging interpolation \n\n\nCode\n###############################\n######## Preparing data for    \n######## kriging interpolatation\n###############################\n\n######### Getting rasta data \nlibrary(terra)\nlibrary(stars)\n\n## Reading night light emission  \nnight_light &lt;- rast(\"source-data/nightlights-2018/Harmonized_DN_NTL_2018_simVIIRS.tif\")\nnight_light &lt;- crop(night_light, vect(st_transform(somail_reg_subset, crs = st_crs(night_light))))\nplot(night_light)\n\n## Reading population density\npop_dense &lt;- rast(\"source-data/worldpop/SOM_pph_2020_adj_v2.tif\")\npop_dense &lt;- crop(pop_dense, vect(st_transform(somail_reg_subset, crs = st_crs(pop_dense))), \"out\")\nplot(pop_dense)\n\n## Reading state reach data regional capitals\nstate_reach &lt;- rast(\"source-data/state_reach/time2regcap_1945_2016_dynroads.tif\")\nstate_reach &lt;- state_reach$time2regcap_1945_2016_dynroads_72\nstate_reach &lt;- crop(state_reach, vect(st_transform(somail_reg_subset, crs = st_crs(state_reach))), \"out\")\nplot(state_reach)\n\n\n## resampling\n# night light\nresampled_night_light &lt;- project(night_light, crs(pop_dense))\nresampled_night_light &lt;- resample(x = resampled_night_light, y = pop_dense)\n\n# state reach \nresampled_state_reach &lt;- project(state_reach, crs(pop_dense))\nresampled_state_reach &lt;- resample(x = resampled_state_reach, y = pop_dense)\n\n### Creating new rasta \ngrid_cov &lt;- rast(list(pop_dense, resampled_night_light, resampled_state_reach))\nnames(grid_cov) &lt;- c(\"pop_dense\", \"night_light\", \"state_reach\")\n\nwriteRaster(grid_cov, \"output-data/grid_cov/grid_cov.tif\", \n            filetype = \"GTiff\", overwrite = TRUE)\n\nrm(night_light)\nrm(resampled_night_light)\nrm(state_reach)\nrm(resampled_state_reach)\nrm(grid_cov)\n\n#### Loading hexagonal data\nlibrary(stars)\n\npop_dense &lt;- read_stars(\"source-data/worldpop/SOM_pph_2020_adj_v2.tif\")\n\nsomali_hex_time &lt;- somali_control_22_23_13\n\nsomali_hex_time &lt;- st_transform(somali_hex_time, crs = st_crs(pop_dense))\n\nsomali_hex_time_centroid &lt;- somali_hex_time |&gt;

    "text": "The provision of security in areas of the African continent governed by fragile states and dominated by frequent conflict is typically seen as limited, if not non-existent. An important question becomes how do people in these areas cope with this situation? Typically, it is assumed that they would either flee or choose to join state forces or rebel groups. Nevertheless, it has increasingly become evident that communities in these areas themselves actually choose to take up arms and provide for their own security by forming vigilante groups, also known as self-defense force or communal militias. However, research tend to lump vigilante groups together with political militias, and therefore see such community initiatives as solely a project commissioned by governments.\nThis analysis departs from the before mentioned approach by arguing that vigilante groups and political militias are distinct categories and viewing vigilante groups as governments’ extended arm limits our theoretical understanding of why such groups emerge.\nTesting what drives the emergence of vigilante groups, this analysis uses digitised road maps and the number of violent encounters in neighboring areas, in order to illuminate how different security environments affects the mobilization of vigilante groups. Though since mobilizing vigilante groups is, in essence, a form of collective action, it is moreover investigated how communities’ ability to conduct collective action condition mobilization in insecure environments. This claim is tested by creating a unique measure that includes data on both social and natural environmental attributes of communities.\nUsing unique panel data of ethnic communities a negative binomial hybrid multilevel regression model is utilized to test empirical the drivers of vigilante group emergence.\n\nCore findings:\n\nVigilante groups have become more active on the African continent in recent years.\nIt is only security environments becoming more hostile that significantly affect vigilante group emergence.\nThe effect of state access on vigilante group emergence is conditioned on both social and natural environmental factors, though the findings are not robust."

    "text": "Vigilante groups as community based actors\nConflicts are normally viewed through the bipolar framework of governments on one side and rebels on the other. However, if we enlarge the number of distinct actors in this theatre of violence our ability to grasp violent conflicts will increase. I will begin by considering the overarching category of non-state actors, which include rebels, private military companies (PMC), and Community-Based Armed Groups (CBAG). CBAGs distinguishes themselves from the two former actor categories by 1) not seeking independence from a government or colonial power, 2) aims to protect the status quo or property rather than capturing the state or pursuing a revolutionary agenda (Schuberth 2015: 299; Peic 2021: 1022; Jentzsch 2022: 14), which is the case of rebels, and 3) have informal relationships with sponsors, unlike PMCs, which operate under formal legal contracts (Schuberth 2015: 298). We can further subdivide CBAGs into the following three categories: vigilante groups, militias, and gangs. Vigilante groups are primarily concerned with local security. They are often formed by local citizens to defend their communities from threats, both internal and external. These groups are typically organized from the bottom-up and operate at the village level (Schuberth 2015: 300; Jentzsch 2022: 16; Barter 2013: 79-80; Ibrahim Shire 2022: 4-5). Vigilante groups may also be referred to as anti-crime groups or civilian self-defense forces (Schuberth 2015: 301-303; Peic 2021: 1022). Militias, on the other hand, are driven by political goals. They form a patron-client relationship with political or ethnic leaders, who provide incentives in exchange for using violence against rivals. Militias are usually mobilized from the top-down, with members motivated by political or ethnic ties (Dearing 2021; Reno 2007: 102; Schuberth 2015: 305). Lastly, gangs, such as drug cartels, are primarily economically motivated (Schuberth 2015: 308).\n\n\n\nPicture of the Kamajors militia that prior to the civil war in Sierra Leone were a class of hunters among the Mende ethnic community who in the face of the civil war were seen by the rest of the community as natural guardians of the community and because of that it was seen as their duty to ensure security (Hoffman 2007: 642).

    "section": "The emergence of vigilante groups",
    "text": "The emergence of vigilante groups\n\nState accessibility\nVigilante groups form in response to security needs where the state fails to provide adequate protection. Civilians mobilize vigilante groups when insecurity rises in regions where the state lacks control or cannot monopolize violence (Chojnacki and Branović 2011: 95). In some cases, state fragility leads to an absence of security, encouraging civilians to take action. Vigilante groups emerge in areas with limited state presence, while militias are more likely to form where the state has a strong military foothold (Barter 2013; Peic 2021). This trend is observed in places like Latin America, Asia, and the Middle East, where vigilante groups appear in ungoverned spaces (Arjona and Kalyvas 2009). Thus we can expect that the activity level of vigilante groups are closely linked to the state’s ability to access and control a region (Müller-Crepon, Hunziker, and Cederman 2021).\n\n\nA hostile security environment\nThe nature of the security environment plays a key role in vigilante group mobilization. Scholars have highlighted how the balance of power between state and rebel forces, as well as the tactics they use, can drive civilians to form vigilante groups. In Mozambique, military stalemates and lack of security guarantees led to the rise of such groups (Jentzsch 2022: 175). Similarly, in Indonesia, repeated rebel attacks against specific ethnic groups sparked vigilante activity (Barter 2013: 89).\nVigilante groups can also emerge in non-civil war environments. For example, in Nigeria and Mexico, groups like the Bakassi Boys were formed in response to criminal gangs (Meagher 2012; Osorio, Schubiger, and Weintraub 2021). In other cases, vigilante groups have mobilized to counter rival ethnic groups (Thomson 2019; Peic 2021).\nThe common theme is that civilians mobilize vigilante groups in response to perceived threats. To better understand this, we can apply Zech’s concept of the “balance of threat,” inspired by structural realism in international relations (Zech 2016: 31). Just as states balance against perceived threats to their survival, civilian communities may do the same when faced with local threats. According to Walt’s theory, threat perception depends on factors like power, proximity, offensive capabilities, and intentions (Walt 1985: 8-9).\nThus, when civilians face hostile actors or uncertain environments, their demand for security increases, and vigilante mobilization follows. This pattern is seen in cases like South Sudan, where the South Sudan Defense Force formed to counter the rebel Sudanese People’s Liberation Army (Arnold 2007), and in Colombia, where civilians formed self-defense groups to protect their communities (Nussio 2011).\n\n\nHaving the ability to mobilize - how strong communities help mobilize vigilante groups\nExplanations focused on a lack of state security and a hostile security environment describe how civilians, due to a lack of security guarantees, are forced to provide for their own safety in a market without a formal security monopolist. However, it would be naive to assume that vigilante group formation is an automatic response to insecurity, as seen in the case of refugees fleeing conflict zones rather than forming vigilante groups. For example, during the second civil war in Southern Sudan, despite attacks from the Sudan People’s Liberation Army on government-free villages, only a few organized vigilante groups for protection (Blocq 2014: 716). A similar pattern was observed in the Peruvian civil war (Zech 2016).\nThis suggests that the willingness of civilians to form vigilante groups in response to insecurity is influenced by other factors. From a rational choice perspective, one such factor is the need to overcome the collective action problem, given that mobilizing vigilante groups is a collective effort (Osorio, Schubiger, and Weintraub 2021: 1568). According to rational choice theory, agents will only participate if the expected benefits outweigh the costs (Olson 1968). Vigilante participation often offers little individual benefit, especially when compared to the risks and effort involved, such as economic costs, exposure to violence, and the lack of protected accommodation (Arjona and Kalyvas 2009; Peic 2021). Moreover, the uncertainty of how many others will join further discourages participation, as a smaller group increases personal risk (Lohmann 1994: 59; Chenoweth and Stephan 2011: 39-40). As Magagna aptly notes, “joining a vigilante group is a dangerous deed, and many would prefer to free-ride if they cannot predict they will not be killed in the process” (Magagna 2019: 46).\nHowever, social structures within communities can alter this cost-benefit analysis, making collective action more likely (Lichbach 1995; Putnam, Leonardi, and Nanetti 1993; Fukuyama 2001; Ostrom and Ahn 2007; Oliver 1993; Granovetter 1973). Research shows that pro-government vigilante groups often emerge from traditional tribal communities, which use vigilante membership to pursue private agendas like inter-tribal feuds or defend their autonomy from outside intervention (Thomson 2019; Peic 2021: 1027-1029; Magagna 2019: 36). These communities may mobilize vigilante groups more easily because of pre-existing social structures that facilitate collective action (Humphreys and Weinstein 2008: 451; Forney 2015: 830; Hoffman 2007: 642; Zech 2016: 191; Jentzsch 2022; Blocq 2014; Menkhaus 2007).\nThese examples show that for vigilante groups to form, potentiel members must be embedded in social structures that reshape their cost-benefit analysis, making participation more likely. However, the precise causal mechanisms linking social structures to vigilante group formation remain varied and inconsistent across cases.\nBased on Lichbach’s extensive review of collective action in rebel groups, this study adopts the concept of community as the unit of social structure. Lichbach defines communities as those characterized by strong social institutions, shared beliefs, and collective behavior (Lichbach 1995: 111). To further understand how community attributes help overcome the collective action problem, this study applies the Institutional Analysis and Development (IAD) framework developed by Ostrom and colleagues (Ostrom, Gardner, and Walker 1994). Given the bottom-up nature of vigilante groups, the IAD framework offers a suitable model for understanding the mechanisms behind their emergence. The framework identifies three components:\n\nAttributes of Community: The structure of the more general community that the arena is situated in.\nRules: Formal and informal rules used by participants as prescriptions of the kind of behaviour that are required, prohibited, and permitted.\nBiophysical/Material Conditions: The attributes of the biophysical/material condition that the actors act upon (Ostrom 2006: 15; McGinnis 2011: 172).\n\nUsing the three factors as a framework for theorising which attributes of a community affect the action situation in such a way that it facilitates collective action, and together with literature relating to the subject of collective action, the study will go through each factor and describe the mechanisms linking the individual factor and collective action.\n\nAttributes of Community:\nFor successful vigilante mobilization, an organizational focal point is necessary. Granovetter’s theory suggests that the nature of social networks plays a key role: strong ties form isolated cliques, while weak ties connect more agents and facilitate broader information flow, reducing the transaction costs of obtaining critical information (Granovetter 1973; Ostrom 2015: 190, 194). In collective action, information on others’ participation is crucial as it helps agents evaluate risks and costs associated with violent actions (Lohmann 1994; Oliver 1993). Additionally, shared norms can create expectations for collective action, where non-participation may result in community sanctions, such as restricted access to common resources (Ostrom 2015: 194; Mason 2004: 17).\nMarwell et al.’s simulations indicate that weak ties centralizing around an organizational focal point significantly influence collective action (Marwell, Oliver, and Prahl 1988). Social institutions, such as governing councils or neighborhoods, can also act as mobilizing structures, driving collective engagement (Mason 2004).\nA second mechanism is the existence of pre-established cooperative arrangements. Communities that engage in cooperative agricultural production, for instance, often exhibit stronger norms of cooperation and reciprocity (Henrich et al. 2001). This link between productive cooperation and collective action is observed in various studies on agricultural practices in Brazil and China (Gneezy, Leibbrandt, and List 2016; Talhelm et al. 2014). Communities that treat land as a common good tend to mobilize protests and collective action more effectively than those with private property systems (Katz 2000; Trasberg 2021; Mearns 1996; Boone 2014).\nThese arrangements foster long-term commitments, reciprocity, and visibility of non-participation, increasing the likelihood of collective security efforts and providing enforcement mechanisms for noncompliance (Axelrod 2006; Zech 2016; Tsai 2007).\n\n\nRules\nTo understand how rules influence vigilante group mobilization, it’s essential to examine whether existing institutions provide formal arrangements that shape agents’ incentives. Rules, both formal and informal, dictate which actions are required, prohibited, or permitted, shaping the action situation (Ostrom 2006: 17-18; Ostrom 2015: 51).\nRules impose costs on specific actions, either material (e.g., monetary) or immaterial (e.g., loss of reputation), which can deter agents from rule-breaking due to future cooperation risks (Ostrom 2015: 98). In collective action, rules help sustain cooperation by ensuring agents trust that their cooperation will be reciprocated and by fostering a general sense of reciprocity (Lichbach 1995: 129-134). The effectiveness of rules depends on the presence of formal or informal institutions that enforce compliance (Lichbach 1995: 132; Ostrom 2006: 20).\nIn some ethnic communities, customary law serves as the basis for internal decision-making and judicial processes (Holzinger et al. 2019; Eck 2014; Wig and Kromrey 2018). A study in Uganda shows that in institutional settings with universal norms of reciprocity and third-party enforcement, individuals prone to free-riding are more likely to participate in collective action (Habyarimana et al. 2009). Similarly, in China, larger clans in rural villages enhance cooperation through informal enforcement of reciprocity (Xu and Yao 2015). Studies also highlight the positive impact of general enforcement rules on farmers’ contributions to common pool resource maintenance (Cao, Zhang, and He 2020; Zang, Wang, and Su 2021).\nIn conclusion, both formal and informal rules affect the ability of communities to mobilize vigilante groups by fostering reciprocity and influencing agents’ cost-benefit analyses. A lack of participation in security provision may affect an agent’s reputation, reducing future cooperation from others.\n\n\nBiophysical/ Material Conditions\nBiophysical/Material Conditions\nThe physical environment plays a crucial role in rural communities’ ability to create and manage collective goods, as well as their potential for mobilizing violent collective action. There are two primary ways this characteristic impacts collective action.\nFirst, spatial features, such as population density, influence social networks. Densely populated areas foster more frequent interactions, improving opportunities for collective action (Weidmann 2009: 538). In contrast, isolated communities, like French smallholder peasants, tend to be self-reliant, with small social networks centered on the family. This isolation hinders the development of class-based political organization and collective action, as observed in various countries (Marx 1852: 62; Paige 1975: 35; Stinchcombe 1961: 45-46).\nSecond, the biophysical features of the land shape social interactions and agricultural production methods. For instance, Boserup’s study of hoe versus plough cultivation found that cultivation methods influenced gender norms, with ploughing requiring more upper-body strength, giving men an advantage and leading to gender-specific roles (Boserup 1972). This finding is supported by a large-N study on cultivation methods and gender norms (Alesina, Giuliano, and Nunn 2013). Similarly, norms of masculinity in America differed between pastoralists and agriculturalists, with the former developing a “culture of honor” that encouraged violent retaliation to uphold justice (Cohen et al. 1996; Grosjean 2014).\nIrrigation systems also play a key role in fostering cooperation. Wittfogel’s study on hydro societies shows that large-scale irrigation projects in arid regions required collective effort, leading to the development of centralized bureaucracies, as seen in ancient Egypt and Babylon (Wittfogel 1957: 18). Ostrom’s research on common pool resources highlights how irrigation systems create norms of cooperation, as users develop complex institutions to manage resources sustainably (Ostrom 2015; Ostrom and Gardner 1993; Lam and Ostrom 2010).\nIrrigation systems not only demonstrate successful social mobilization but also serve as organizational focal points for social interaction. Studies show that communities relying on irrigation, such as rice farmers in China, have stronger norms of collectivism compared to wheat farmers, due to the higher labor and cooperation demands of rice cultivation (Talhelm et al. 2014). Similarly, farmers in the Philippines involved in irrigation schemes display more cooperative behavior than those relying on rainfed techniques (Tsusaka et al. 2015; Fujiie, Hayami, and Kikuchi 2005). In Pakistan and India, traditional irrigation systems are seen as essential to community structure and social interaction (Mustafa and Qazi 2007; von Carnap 2017). In conclusion, rural areas that depend on irrigation tend to develop strong norms of cooperation and extensive social networks, making them more capable of mobilizing vigilante groups.\n\n\n\nFigure 1 - The three dimensions facilitating collective action"

    "text": "The dependent variable: Vigilante activity\nVigilante mobilization is measured using geo-referenced data on conflict events. Data is provided by The Armed Conflict Location & Event Data Project (ACLED), that is generated using news sources, expert and NGO reports on violent and non-violent conflict events worldwide, with a particular focus on Africa.\nConflict events consist of a series of actions realized by one actor or between multiple actors. Contrary to similar data sets, there is not a fatality-based threshold for the inclusion of events, nor do they have to be part of pre-defined modes of organised violence. This approach allows the study to include a broader subset of actions carried out by vigilante groups (Raleigh et al. 2010). Investigating vigilante group presence the analysis will use the ACLED defined actor categories of communal militia or an identity militia which is defined as: “organised around a collective, common feature including community, region, religion or, in exceptional cases, livelihood”. Moreover, ACLED also categorises whether groups can be defined as political militias, thus it is ensured that our signal of the appearance of vigilante groups is not confused with that of militias as descirbed in section on CBAGs.\n\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(sjPlot)\nlibrary(viridis)\nlibrary(sf)\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(wesanderson)\nlibrary(ggpubr)\nlibrary(vtable)\nlibrary(cshapes)\nlibrary(countrycode)\n\nsf::sf_use_s2(FALSE)\n\n\n\n\nCode\n### The epr_tgg data \nepr_tgg &lt;- read_sf(paste0(getwd(), \"/EPR_TGG_final.shp\"))\n\n### Without geometry\nepr_tgg_heat &lt;- epr_tgg %&gt;%  \n  as.data.frame() %&gt;% \n  dplyr::select(-geometry)\n\n########||||||||||||||||||||||||||\n### Spatial map of violence in ethnic areas and over time\n### in selected groups           \n########||||||||||||||||||||||||||\n\nheat_ &lt;- epr_tgg_heat %&gt;% \n  group_by(gwgropd) %&gt;% \n  mutate(total_events = sum(n_vntDV)) %&gt;% \n  filter(total_events &gt; 10) %&gt;% \n  ungroup() %&gt;% \n  ggplot(mapping = aes(x= year, y= reorder(group, n_vntDV), fill= log(n_vntDV+1))) +\n  geom_tile() +\n  scale_y_discrete(labels = function(x){str_c(str_sub(x,end = 20),\".\")}) +\n  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(2000, 2016)) +\n  theme_minimal() + \n  labs(fill = \"Vigilante group activity on a log scale\", x = \"\", y= \"\") +\n  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(size=9, angle=60, hjust=1)) +\n  theme(legend.position = \"top\", legend.title.align=0.5, \n        legend.key.width = unit(2.6, \"cm\"), \n        legend.key.height = unit(0.3, \"cm\")) +\n  scale_fill_gradientn(colours = pal) +\n  guides(fill = guide_colorbar(title.position = \"top\", ))\n\n\npal &lt;- wes_palette(\"Zissou1\", 100, type = \"continuous\")\n\ncountry_border &lt;- cshp(date = as.Date(\"2019-12-31\"))\n\ncountry_border &lt;- country_border %&gt;% \n  mutate(region = countrycode(country_name, origin = 'country.name', destination = 'un.regionsub.name')) %&gt;% \n  filter(region %in% c(\"Sub-Saharan Africa\", \"Northern Africa\"))\n  \nmap_1 &lt;- epr_tgg %&gt;% \n  group_by(gwgropd) %&gt;% \n  summarise(tot_n_vntDV = sum(n_vntDV, na.rm = T)) %&gt;% \n  mutate(tot_n_vntDV = as.numeric(log(tot_n_vntDV+1))) %&gt;% \n  ggplot() + \n  geom_sf(data = country_border, color = \"black\", size = 0.5, fill = NA) +\n  geom_sf(aes(fill = tot_n_vntDV)) + \n  scale_fill_gradientn(colours = pal) +\n  theme_bw() +\n  theme(legend.position = \"none\")\n\n\n\nfigure_2 &lt;- ggarrange(map_1, heat_ + font(\"x.text\", size = 10),\n                    ncol = 1, nrow = 2, labels=\"AUTO\")\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2 - Vigilante activity across time and space on the African continent"

    "text": "Independent variables\n\nState access\nState access in Africa is closely connected with the state’s ability to physically reach its population. Here the character of a state’s transportation network plays a vital role since it constitutes the foundational infrastructure that permits the state to build and maintain institutions that can ensure social order (Müller-Crepon, Hunziker, and Cederman 2021: 568). Following Müller-Crepon and Müller-Crepon et. al. measuring state accessibility is done based on the average travel time from a country’s capital or regional capitals to individuals inside an ethnic group’s settlement areas. This is calculated using a weighted population average that has the following mathematical form:\n\\[\nstate\\space access_g = ln\\bigg(\\frac{1}{I_g}\\sum_{i=1}^{I_g}1+time_C,_i\\bigg)\n\\]\nHere \\(time_C,_i\\) denotes the travelling time from the country or regional capital, \\(C\\), to an individual \\(i\\) using the shortest possible path. \\(I_g\\) enumerates individuals belonging to an ethnic settlement area (\\(g\\)), constituting the population weight used in the formula. Using a population-weighted mean ensures that the travelling time to more densely populated areas is weighted higher than that of sparsely populated ones. I log transform the measure, since it better captures the convex relationship between the capacity of the state to assert itself in an area and travelling time (Müller-Crepon 2021: 2). To compute the formula gridded raster data on travelling times and population counts are used together with EPR polygons to devise the final measure. Data on travelling time is provided by Müller-Crepon, who uses digitised footpaths and road networks of Africa to estimate the travelling time from a given grid-cell to either the national or regional capital per year. The approach is similar to Google maps and considers the condition of roads when estimating travelling time (Müller-Crepon 2021). The main advantage of this data source is the time scale of the data, as it allows us to investigate the within variation in our independent variable. Population data is provided by the WorldPop project that, through the use of UN population census data and covariates, is combined in a machine learning model so to be able to accurately estimate the number of people living inside an ethnic group’s settlement area \\(I_g\\) and the approximate location of individual group members \\(i\\) per year (WorldPop 2018). The thesis opts for the unconstrained version of the dataset that does not take into consideration settlement patterns when estimating population counts, as the accuracy of these data sources has been found to vary through time and between spatial units, thereby limiting the comparative potential of the analysis (Stevens et al. 2015).\nThe final measure based on travelling time from the national capital ranges from -0.58 to 4.12, where higher values indicate an increase in the mean travelling time to members of an ethnic group on a log scale.\n\n\nSecurity environment\nMeasuring the security environment in which ethnic groups reside in, the number of violent encounters in neighbouring ethnic areas are used. Using ACLED data, a subset of violent encounters are chosen based on whether rebels, militias or other vigilante groups are involved in violence or one-sided violence against government forces, civilians or between the before mentioned groups. These encounters are chosen as research has highlighted that vigilante groups have, in a number of cases, been mobilised as a response to the activity level of these groups (Zech 2016; Peic 2021; Jentzsch 2022). The number of violent encounters in neighbouring ethnic areas are applied, so to create a spatial lag of the average threat level in neighbouring ethnic groups’ settlement area, thereby capturing the potential for aggression towards a given ethnic group. The spatial-lag is given by the following formula, where \\(N_g\\) is the number of neighbouring ethnic groups and \\(activity_n\\) is the activity level in each of the neighbouring areas (\\(n\\)).\n\\[\n\\text{security environment} = \\frac{1}{N_g}\\sum_{i = 1}^{N_g}acitivity_n\n\\]"

    "text": "Ability to conduct collective action\nTo gauge whether the community attributes, rules and norms relating to a given ethnic group, data on ethnic groups’ traditional governance structures in Africa is applied. This data source originates from a web survey where a diverse set of experts on ethnic groups were asked to answer a series of questions about the group of their expertise. The questions revolve around the internal institutional structure of an ethnic group and their level of centralization, as well as their formal and informal interactions with state institutions.\n\nAttributes of Community\nMeasuring whether ethnic groups have an institutional setting that can act as an organisational focal point to disperse information between members, the following collective decision-making bodies have been chosen:\n\nCouncil of elders\nCustomary assembly\nLevel of customary institution\n\nWhen it comes to the existence of cooperative arrangements between individuals in ethnic communities, the following unofficial and official functions of traditional organisations are chosen:\n\nLand administration\nNatural resource management\nSecurity matters, peace and order\nDispute resolution\nInfrastructural provisions\n\nThe chosen components are all binary, indicating the presence of such a function. They are chosen on the ground on whether they are assessed as requiring cooperation between individuals.\n\n\nRules\nGauging the presence of rules and norms in a community, the following three binary questions regarding the presence of the bellow are chosen. They are chosen on the ground that they capture both informal and formal rules, but moreover that they have institutional bodies to enforce such rules.\n\nWhether ethnic groups have customary rules and norms\nWhether ethnic groups have customary courts\nWhether ethnic groups have mechanisms for dispute resolutions\n\n\n\nBiophysical/ Material Conditions\nThe biophysical/material conditions of an ethnic community are measured using two measures.\nFirstly, when measuring the spatial dispersion of a group, this study follows the proposed method by Weidmann of how to calculate the degree that members of an ethnic group is dispersed. The central measure is denoted “\\(D\\)” where higher values correspond to more dispersed groups, and is calculated using the below formula:\n\\[\n    D= \\frac{\\underset{i,j \\in\\{1..N\\}, i &lt; j}{\\sum p(c_i) p(c_j) log(d(c_i,c_j))}}{\\underset{i,j \\in\\{1..N\\}, i &lt; j}{\\sum p(c_i) p(c_j)}}\n\\]\nUsing gridded population data from the WorldPop project, the formula uses the number of people inside each settlement cluster, denoted “\\(P(C_n)\\)” and the logged minimal geodesic distance between each cluster “\\(d(…)\\)”. By computing a population-weighted average of the logged minimal geodesic distances between clusters, a measure is created where the distance between heavily populated clusters is weighted higher than that of sparsely populated ones (Weidmann 2009: 536). The measure ranges from 0 to 6.31, where lower values indicate that ethnic groups are more centralised, whereas higher values indicates more dispersed ethnic groups.\nThe second measure captures to what extent an ethnic group is cultivating their land using irrigation techniques. The measure is devised using satellite data from The Copernicus Climate Change Service (CCI) on land use and population data from the WorldPop project. The land use data is generated using an algorithm that applies different satellites and machine learning classification techniques so to be able to generate yearly assessments of what a given grid-cell of land is being used for. Importantly for this study, the data records whether a grid-cell is classified as “Cropland, irrigated or post-flooding”, indicating if irrigation is used as the primary cultivating technique in an area (ESA 2017). The final measure is created by combining land use data, ethnic settlement areas and WorldPop population data, enabling the study to calculate the percentage of an ethnic group’s members living in cropland areas being irrigated. Moreover, as it is not affected by the dependent variable i.e. conflict related violence, it is ensured that the measure does not induce a systematic bias in the final results (Schultz and Mankin 2019). The scale of the measure ranges from 0% to 100% where higher values indicate that a larger share of members of an ethnic group living in areas being irrigated."

Moreover, looking at model 11, it becomes apparent that here too there is a positive but a significant effect of the security environment becoming more hostile.\nTesting if reporting bias affects the interaction hypothesis, table 2 in appendix 2 investigates whether the findings in table 4 in the analysis change when using the dichotomised dependent variable. Here we see that the interaction effects SADM X Collective institution and SADM X Irrigated pop DM both become insignificant, indicating that reporting bias might be affecting this area of the analysis. It could be argued that the above result is instead a product of the change in functional form from a negative binomial to a logistic form. In order to assess whether that is the case, four specification curve analyses are performed regarding how a change in functional form affects the results relating to the effect of state presence and the security environment and the two before mentioned interaction terms. In these analyses, different regression models are fitted to the original dataset using the following four functional forms:\n\nHybrid-multilevel model using a Poisson distribution (ML poisson)\nHybrid-multilevel model using a Negative Ninomial distribution (ML negative binomial)\nLinear hybrid-multilevel model where vigilante group activity is on a log-scale (ML linear (log))\nA three-way linear fixed effect model where vigilante group activity is on a log-scale (FE linear (log))\n\nBesides varying the functional form, the analyses also investigate how changing which confounders are included affects the result. Only the models where all confounders are included will be considered in this section.\nFigure 4.A1 depicts the specification curve relating to the effect of a change in the security environment, and the interaction hypothesis SADM X Irrigated pop DM is shown in figure 4.A2.\nLooking at plot 6.A1, we see that changing the functional form of the model only has a limited effect on the final results regarding the effect of the security environment since all models estimate the within effect to be between 0.0021 and 0.0031 on a log-scale, and be significantly different from zero.\n\n\n\n\nA different pattern emerges when it comes to the within effect of state access, which is depicted in figure 1 in appendix 2. Here both ML negative binomial and FE linear (log) estimates an insignificant effect of 0.2, whereas ML Poisson and ML linear (log) estimate a significant effect spanning from 0.2 to 4. Moreover, changing the state access measure to one where transport time is calculated from the regional capital (SADM (regional)) instead of the national capital also has a major impact on the final result, as all models with the exception of the FE linear (log) estimates a significant effect ranging from 0.3 to 4.9. Thereby, lending support to hypothesis 1.\nMoving to plot A2 in figure 4, depicting a specification curve for the interaction term SADM X Irrigated pop DM two surprising results becomes apparent. Firstly, the choice of functional form has a noteworthy effect on the effect size, as the nonlinear models estimate a significant effect ranging from -38.4 to -28.6. In contrast, the linear models estimate it to be around 1, and it is only significant when estimated using ML linear (log). Secondly, it also becomes apparent that how the interaction term is created affects whether the effect of the interaction term becomes negative or positive. When the interaction term is calculated using the double de-meaned method it becomes negative, whereas when using the de-meaned method it becomes positive. A similar effect of the choice of functional form is also seen when it comes to the effect size of the interaction term SADM X Collective institution, which is depicted in figure 2 appendix 2.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(specr)\nlibrary(lme4)\nlibrary(glmmTMB)\nlibrary(fixest)\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(data.table)\nlibrary(ggpubr)\nlibrary(margins)\nlibrary(ggeffects)\nlibrary(stringr)\nlibrary(marginaleffects)\nlibrary(sjPlot)\n################################################\n################################################\n########||||||||||||||||||||||||||\n###

Specification curve analysis\n\n\nThe sensitivity analysis shows that the results of the analysis regarding state access and the security environment are not affected by reporting bias. Though there are indications of it affecting the estimation of the interaction hypotheses. However, the method used to assess whether reporting bias is present is not able to discern between if it is reporting bias or the change in the functional form of the statistical model that is affecting the final results. In order to understand whether that is the case, a series of specification curve analyses were conducted, making it possible to assess if a change in the functional form, number of confounders, national or regional capital and how the interaction term is created affects the final results.\nOverall, the significant effect of a change in the security environment is the most robust finding in this study. When it comes to the effect of state access, changing the functional form has an effect on the estimated size and significance level. Most noteworthy calculating state access using regional capitals instead of only the national ones has a substantial effect on the findings of the analysis. Furthermore, both functional form and how interaction effects are created also have a substantial effect on the findings of this study. Firstly, it indicates that we should be conscious of how to assess interaction hypotheses in linear and nonlinear models. Secondly, these results do not mean that the double de-meaned estimator is a misspecification, actually the opposite as the non-double de-meaned estimator estimates a positive effect, which conflicts with the graphical representation in figure 5."
