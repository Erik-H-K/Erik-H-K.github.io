Knudsen\"\ndescription: |\n  An analysis that explores different explanations of why people on the African continent choose to mobilise vigilante groups and how often they engage in violent clashes. \ndate: 2022-10-19\ncategories: [Spatial analysis, Conflict research, Africa, Non-state Actors, Hybrid Order]\nformat: \n  html:\n    code-fold: true\n    code-tools: true\nimage: figures/figure_3_heat_map.png\ndraft: false\nbibliography: Mit Citat Bibliotek.json\n---\n\n\n# Summary \nThe provision of security in areas of the African continent governed by fragile states and dominated by frequent conflict is typically seen as limited, if not non-existent. An important question becomes how do people in these areas cope with this situation? Typically, it is assumed that they would either flee or choose to join state forces or rebel groups. Nevertheless, it has increasingly become evident that communities in these areas themselves actually choose to take up arms and provide for their own security by forming vigilante groups, also known as self-defense force or communal militias. However, research tend to lump vigilante groups together with political militias, and therefore see such community initiatives as solely a project commissioned by governments.\\\nThis analysis departs from the before mentioned approach by arguing that vigilante groups and political militias are distinct categories and viewing vigilante groups as governments’ extended arm limits our theoretical understanding of why such groups emerge.\\\nTesting what drives the emergence of vigilante groups, this analysis uses digitised road maps and the number of violent encounters in neighboring areas, in order to illuminate how different security environments affects the mobilization of vigilante groups. Though since mobilizing vigilante groups is, in essence, a form of collective action, it is moreover investigated how communities' ability to conduct collective action condition mobilization in insecure environments. This claim is tested by creating a unique measure that includes data on both social and natural environmental attributes of communities. \\\nUsing unique panel data of ethnic communities a negative binomial hybrid multilevel regression model is utilized to test empirical the drivers of vigilante group emergence.\\\n\nCore findings:\n\n* Vigilante groups have become more active on the African continent in recent years.\n* It is only security environments becoming more hostile that significantly affect vigilante group emergence. \n* The effect of state access on vigilante group emergence is conditioned on both social and natural environmental factors, though the findings are not robust.\n\n\n# No such thing as an ungoverned space - An introduction\nThe state is often defined by its monopoly on legitimate violence and control over a defined territory [@Weber1926]. Fragile or collapsed states, unable to meet these criteria, are commonly seen as chaotic and insecure, where life becomes \"nasty, brutish, and short\" [@Hobbes2017]. This view dominates both academic and policy discussions, especially concerning regions like the Sahel, where many see widespread anarchy [@Glawion2020; @Fukuyama2004; @OECD2020].\n\nHowever, the reality is more nuanced. While central governments in fragile states may be weak, various non-state actors—including traditional authorities, rebel groups, and vigilante organizations — often step in to govern and provide security [@Zartman1995; @Boege.etal2009]. This phenomenon is known as \"hybrid order,\" where state authority is shared, not entirely absent [@Risse-Kappen2011; @Glawion2020].\n\nThis analysis explores how civilians in these hybrid orders respond to insecurity, focusing on the rise of vigilante groups. These groups, composed of ordinary citizens, take on security roles in the absence of effective state or rebel forces [@Schuberth2015; @Frowd2022]. This is an interesting phenomenon, because, rather than fleeing or joining armed factions in a conflict, these communities instead chooses to mobilize, in order, to protect themselves.\n\nUsing data on vigilante activity across Africa from 2000 to 2016, this analysis will try to understand what drives their formation. Consequently, this analysis diverges firstly from the conventional view of fragile states as purely anarchic, and secondly highlights how local populations are not only passive bystanders in violent conflicts, but actually possesses agency when trying to create order and security in otherwise ungoverned spaces [@Osorio.etal2021; @Jentzsch2022].\n\n# Whom and why? \nI will in this section outline what I mean by vigilante groups. Moreover, drawing on theories of mobilization and of the security environment, I will deduce predictions of why vigilante groups appear and their level of activity. Predictions that subsequently will guide me on the design of my statistical model. \n\n## Vigilante groups as community based actors\nConflicts are normally viewed through the bipolar framework of governments on one side and rebels on the other. However, if we enlarge the number of distinct actors in this theatre of violence our ability to grasp violent conflicts will increase. I will begin by considering the overarching category of *non-state actors*, which include rebels, private military companies (PMC), and Community-Based Armed Groups (CBAG). CBAGs distinguishes themselves from the two former actor categories by 1) not seeking independence from a government or colonial power, 2) aims to protect the status quo or property rather than capturing the state or pursuing a revolutionary agenda [@Schuberth2015: 299; @Peic2021: 1022; @Jentzsch2022: 14], which is the case of rebels, and 3) have informal relationships with sponsors, unlike PMCs, which operate under formal legal contracts [@Schuberth2015: 298]. \nWe can further subdivide CBAGs into the following three categories: vigilante groups, militias, and gangs. Vigilante groups are primarily concerned with local security. They are often formed by local citizens to defend their communities from threats, both internal and external. These groups are typically organized from the bottom-up and operate at the village level [@Schuberth2015: 300; @Jentzsch2022: 16; @Barter2013: 79-80; @IbrahimShire2022: 4-5]. Vigilante groups may also be referred to as anti-crime groups or civilian self-defense forces [@Schuberth2015: 301-303; @Peic2021: 1022]. Militias, on the other hand, are driven by political goals. They form a patron-client relationship with political or ethnic leaders, who provide incentives in exchange for using violence against rivals. Militias are usually mobilized from the top-down, with members motivated by political or ethnic ties [@Dearing2021; @Reno2007: 102; @Schuberth2015: 305]. Lastly, gangs, such as drug cartels, are primarily economically motivated [@Schuberth2015: 308].\n\n![Picture of the Kamajors militia that prior to the civil war in Sierra Leone were a class of hunters among the Mende ethnic community who in the face of the civil war were seen by the rest of the community as natural guardians of the community and because of that it was seen as their duty to ensure security [@Hoffman2007: 642]. Picture by Teun Voeten/Panos Pictures/Felix Features](pictures/TVO00005SRL.jpg)\n\n## The emergence of vigilante groups\n### State accessibility\nVigilante groups form in response to security needs where the state fails to provide adequate protection. Civilians mobilize vigilante groups when insecurity rises in regions where the state lacks control or cannot monopolize violence [@Chojnacki.Branovic2011: 95]. \nIn some cases, state fragility leads to an absence of security, encouraging civilians to take action. Vigilante groups emerge in areas with limited state presence, while militias are more likely to form where the state has a strong military foothold [@Barter2013; @Peic2021]. This trend is observed in places like Latin America, Asia, and the Middle East, where vigilante groups appear in ungoverned spaces [@Arjona.Kalyvas2009].\nThus we can expect that the activity level of vigilante groups are closely linked to the state's ability to access and control a region [@Muller-Crepon.etal2021].\n\n### A hostile security environment\nThe nature of the security environment plays a key role in vigilante group mobilization. Scholars have highlighted how the balance of power between state and rebel forces, as well as the tactics they use, can drive civilians to form vigilante groups. In Mozambique, military stalemates and lack of security guarantees led to the rise of such groups [@Jentzsch2022: 175]. Similarly, in Indonesia, repeated rebel attacks against specific ethnic groups sparked vigilante activity [@Barter2013: 89].\n\nVigilante groups can also emerge in non-civil war environments. For example, in Nigeria and Mexico, groups like the Bakassi Boys were formed in response to criminal gangs [@Meagher2012; @Osorio.etal2021]. In other cases, vigilante groups have mobilized to counter rival ethnic groups [@Thomson2019; @Peic2021].\n\nThe common theme is that civilians mobilize vigilante groups in response to perceived threats. To better understand this, we can apply Zech's concept of the \"balance of threat,\" inspired by structural realism in international relations [@Zech2016: 31]. Just as states balance against perceived threats to their survival, civilian communities may do the same when faced with local threats. According to Walt's theory, threat perception depends on factors like power, proximity, offensive capabilities, and intentions [@Walt1985: 8-9].\n\nThus, when civilians face hostile actors or uncertain environments, their demand for security increases, and vigilante mobilization follows. This pattern is seen in cases like South Sudan, where the South Sudan Defense Force formed to counter the rebel Sudanese People's Liberation Army [@Arnold2007], and in Colombia, where civilians formed self-defense groups to protect their communities [@Nussio2011].\n\n### Having the ability to mobilize - how strong communities help mobilize vigilante groups\n\nExplanations focused on a lack of state security and a hostile security environment describe how civilians, due to a lack of security guarantees, are forced to provide for their own safety in a market without a formal security monopolist. However, it would be naive to assume that vigilante group formation is an automatic response to insecurity, as seen in the case of refugees fleeing conflict zones rather than forming vigilante groups. For example, during the second civil war in Southern Sudan, despite attacks from the Sudan People's Liberation Army on government-free villages, only a few organized vigilante groups for protection [@Blocq2014: 716]. A similar pattern was observed in the Peruvian civil war [@Zech2016].\n\nThis suggests that the willingness of civilians to form vigilante groups in response to insecurity is influenced by other factors. From a rational choice perspective, one such factor is the need to overcome the collective action problem, given that mobilizing vigilante groups is a collective effort [@Osorio.etal2021: 1568]. According to rational choice theory, agents will only participate if the expected benefits outweigh the costs [@Olson1968]. Vigilante participation often offers little individual benefit, especially when compared to the risks and effort involved, such as economic costs, exposure to violence, and the lack of protected accommodation [@Arjona.Kalyvas2009; @Peic2021]. Moreover, the uncertainty of how many others will join further discourages participation, as a smaller group increases personal risk [@Lohmann1994: 59; @Chenoweth.Stephan2011: 39-40]. As Magagna aptly notes, “joining a vigilante group is a dangerous deed, and many would prefer to free-ride if they cannot predict they will not be killed in the process” [@Magagna2019: 46].\n\nHowever, social structures within communities can alter this cost-benefit analysis, making collective action more likely [@Lichbach1995; @Putnam.etal1993; @Fukuyama2001; @Ostrom.Ahn2007; @Oliver1993; @Granovetter1973]. Research shows that pro-government vigilante groups often emerge from traditional tribal communities, which use vigilante membership to pursue private agendas like inter-tribal feuds or defend their autonomy from outside intervention [@Thomson2019; @Peic2021: 1027-1029; @Magagna2019: 36]. These communities may mobilize vigilante groups more easily because of pre-existing social structures that facilitate collective action [@Humphreys.Weinstein2008: 451; @Forney2015: 830; @Hoffman2007: 642; @Zech2016: 191; @Jentzsch2022; @Blocq2014; @Menkhaus2007].\n\nThese examples show that for vigilante groups to form, potentiel members must be embedded in social structures that reshape their cost-benefit analysis, making participation more likely. However, the precise causal mechanisms linking social structures to vigilante group formation remain varied and inconsistent across cases.\n\nBased on Lichbach’s extensive review of collective action in rebel groups, this study adopts the concept of community as the unit of social structure. Lichbach defines communities as those characterized by strong social institutions, shared beliefs, and collective behavior [@Lichbach1995: 111]. To further understand how community attributes help overcome the collective action problem, this study applies the Institutional Analysis and Development (IAD) framework developed by Ostrom and colleagues [@Ostrom.etal1994]. Given the bottom-up nature of vigilante groups, the IAD framework offers a suitable model for understanding the mechanisms behind their emergence. The framework identifies three components: \n\n1)  *Attributes of Community*: The structure of the more general community that the arena is situated in.\n2)  *Rules*: Formal and informal rules used by participants as prescriptions of the kind of behaviour that are required, prohibited, and permitted.\n3)  *Biophysical/Material Conditions*: The attributes of the biophysical/material condition that the actors act upon [@Ostrom2006: 15; @McGinnis2011: 172].\n\nUsing the three factors as a framework for theorising which attributes of a community affect the action situation in such a way that it facilitates collective action, and together with literature relating to the subject of collective action, the study will go through each factor and describe the mechanisms linking the individual factor and collective action.\n\n#### Attributes of Community: \nFor successful vigilante mobilization, an organizational focal point is necessary. Granovetter's theory suggests that the nature of social networks plays a key role: strong ties form isolated cliques, while weak ties connect more agents and facilitate broader information flow, reducing the transaction costs of obtaining critical information [@Granovetter1973; @Ostrom2015: 190, 194]. In collective action, information on others' participation is crucial as it helps agents evaluate risks and costs associated with violent actions [@Lohmann1994; @Oliver1993]. Additionally, shared norms can create expectations for collective action, where non-participation may result in community sanctions, such as restricted access to common resources [@Ostrom2015: 194; @Mason2004: 17].\n\nMarwell et al.'s simulations indicate that weak ties centralizing around an organizational focal point significantly influence collective action [@Marwell.etal1988]. Social institutions, such as governing councils or neighborhoods, can also act as mobilizing structures, driving collective engagement [@Mason2004].\n\nA second mechanism is the existence of pre-established cooperative arrangements. Communities that engage in cooperative agricultural production, for instance, often exhibit stronger norms of cooperation and reciprocity [@Henrich.etal2001]. This link between productive cooperation and collective action is observed in various studies on agricultural practices in Brazil and China [@Gneezy.etal2016; @Talhelm.etal2014]. Communities that treat land as a common good tend to mobilize protests and collective action more effectively than those with private property systems [@Katz2000; @Trasberg2021; @Mearns1996; @Boone2014].\n\nThese arrangements foster long-term commitments, reciprocity, and visibility of non-participation, increasing the likelihood of collective security efforts and providing enforcement mechanisms for noncompliance [@Axelrod2006; @Zech2016; @Tsai2007].\n\n#### Rules\nTo understand how rules influence vigilante group mobilization, it's essential to examine whether existing institutions provide formal arrangements that shape agents' incentives. Rules, both formal and informal, dictate which actions are required, prohibited, or permitted, shaping the action situation [@Ostrom2006: 17-18; @Ostrom2015: 51].\n\nRules impose costs on specific actions, either material (e.g., monetary) or immaterial (e.g., loss of reputation), which can deter agents from rule-breaking due to future cooperation risks [@Ostrom2015: 98]. In collective action, rules help sustain cooperation by ensuring agents trust that their cooperation will be reciprocated and by fostering a general sense of reciprocity [@Lichbach1995: 129-134]. The effectiveness of rules depends on the presence of formal or informal institutions that enforce compliance [@Lichbach1995: 132; @Ostrom2006: 20].\n\nIn some ethnic communities, customary law serves as the basis for internal decision-making and judicial processes [@Holzinger.etal2019; @Eck2014; @Wig.Kromrey2018]. A study in Uganda shows that in institutional settings with universal norms of reciprocity and third-party enforcement, individuals prone to free-riding are more likely to participate in collective action [@Habyarimana.etal2009]. Similarly, in China, larger clans in rural villages enhance cooperation through informal enforcement of reciprocity [@Xu.Yao2015]. Studies also highlight the positive impact of general enforcement rules on farmers' contributions to common pool resource maintenance [@Cao.etal2020; @Zang.etal2021].\n\nIn conclusion, both formal and informal rules affect the ability of communities to mobilize vigilante groups by fostering reciprocity and influencing agents' cost-benefit analyses. A lack of participation in security provision may affect an agent's reputation, reducing future cooperation from others.\n\n#### Biophysical/ Material Conditions\nBiophysical/Material Conditions\n\nThe physical environment plays a crucial role in rural communities' ability to create and manage collective goods, as well as their potential for mobilizing violent collective action. There are two primary ways this characteristic impacts collective action.\n\nFirst, spatial features, such as population density, influence social networks. Densely populated areas foster more frequent interactions, improving opportunities for collective action [@Weidmann2009: 538]. In contrast, isolated communities, like French smallholder peasants, tend to be self-reliant, with small social networks centered on the family. This isolation hinders the development of class-based political organization and collective action, as observed in various countries [@Marx1852: 62; @Paige1975: 35; @Stinchcombe1961: 45-46].\n\nSecond, the biophysical features of the land shape social interactions and agricultural production methods. For instance, Boserup's study of hoe versus plough cultivation found that cultivation methods influenced gender norms, with ploughing requiring more upper-body strength, giving men an advantage and leading to gender-specific roles [@Boserup1972]. This finding is supported by a large-N study on cultivation methods and gender norms [@Alesina.etal2013]. Similarly, norms of masculinity in America differed between pastoralists and agriculturalists, with the former developing a \"culture of honor\" that encouraged violent retaliation to uphold justice [@Cohen.etal1996; @Grosjean2014].\n\nIrrigation systems also play a key role in fostering cooperation. Wittfogel’s study on hydro societies shows that large-scale irrigation projects in arid regions required collective effort, leading to the development of centralized bureaucracies, as seen in ancient Egypt and Babylon [@Wittfogel1957: 18]. Ostrom’s research on common pool resources highlights how irrigation systems create norms of cooperation, as users develop complex institutions to manage resources sustainably [@Ostrom2015; @Ostrom.Gardner1993; @Lam.Ostrom2010].\n\nIrrigation systems not only demonstrate successful social mobilization but also serve as organizational focal points for social interaction. Studies show that communities relying on irrigation, such as rice farmers in China, have stronger norms of collectivism compared to wheat farmers, due to the higher labor and cooperation demands of rice cultivation [@Talhelm.etal2014]. Similarly, farmers in the Philippines involved in irrigation schemes display more cooperative behavior than those relying on rainfed techniques [@Tsusaka.etal2015; @Fujiie.etal2005]. In Pakistan and India, traditional irrigation systems are seen as essential to community structure and social interaction [@Mustafa.Qazi2007; @vonCarnap2017]. In conclusion, rural areas that depend on irrigation tend to develop strong norms of cooperation and extensive social networks, making them more capable of mobilizing vigilante groups.\n\n![**Figure 1** - The three dimensions facilitating collective action](figures/figure_8.png)\n\n# Data and operationalisation\nThe empirical analysis is conducted using ethnic settlement areas as the spatial unit of analysis. The choice of ethnic groups is grounded in the fact that ethnic groups on the African function as an essential community identifier for individuals [@Ekeh1975: 107]. As a result, it allows the study to come closer to the actual social institutions that shape peoples' behavior, thereby more accurately gauge how communities condition vigilante mobilization.\\\nData on ethnic settlement areas are provided by the Geo-referencing Ethnic Power Relations (GeoEPR hereafter) project, which collects information on the relationship between state power and politically relevant ethnic groups. The project defines ethnicity as: \"*any subjectively experienced sense of commonality based on the belief in common ancestry and shared culture*\", and accounts a group as being politically relevant if a significant political actor claims to represent it in the political arena or if the group is experiencing political discrimination.\\\n\n## The dependent variable: Vigilante activity \nVigilante mobilization is measured using geo-referenced data on conflict events. Data is provided by The Armed Conflict Location & Event Data Project (ACLED), that is generated using news sources, expert and NGO reports on violent and non-violent conflict events worldwide, with a particular focus on Africa.\\\nConflict events consist of a series of actions realized by one actor or between multiple actors. Contrary to similar data sets, there is not a fatality-based threshold for the inclusion of events, nor do they have to be part of pre-defined modes of organised violence. This approach allows the study to include a broader subset of actions carried out by vigilante groups [@Raleigh.etal2010].\\ Investigating vigilante group presence the analysis will use the ACLED defined actor categories of *communal militia* or an *identity militia* which is defined as: \"*organised around a collective, common feature including community, region, religion or, in exceptional cases, livelihood*\". Moreover, ACLED also categorises whether groups can be defined as *political militias*, thus it is ensured that our signal of the appearance of vigilante groups is not confused with that of militias as descirbed in section on CBAGs.\\\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(sjPlot)\nlibrary(viridis)\nlibrary(sf)\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(wesanderson)\nlibrary(ggpubr)\nlibrary(vtable)\nlibrary(cshapes)\nlibrary(countrycode)\n\nsf::sf_use_s2(FALSE)\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n### The epr_tgg data \nepr_tgg <- read_sf(paste0(getwd(), \"/EPR_TGG_final.shp\"))\n\n### Without geometry\nepr_tgg_heat <- epr_tgg %>%  \n  as.data.frame() %>% \n  dplyr::select(-geometry)\n\n########||||||||||||||||||||||||||\n### Spatial map of violence in ethnic areas and over time\n### in selected groups           \n########||||||||||||||||||||||||||\n\nheat_ <- epr_tgg_heat %>% \n  group_by(gwgropd) %>% \n  mutate(total_events = sum(n_vntDV)) %>% \n  filter(total_events > 10) %>% \n  ungroup() %>% \n  ggplot(mapping = aes(x= year, y= reorder(group, n_vntDV), fill= log(n_vntDV+1))) +\n  geom_tile() +\n  scale_y_discrete(labels = function(x){str_c(str_sub(x,end = 20),\".\")}) +\n  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(2000, 2016)) +\n  theme_minimal() + \n  labs(fill = \"Vigilante group activity on a log scale\", x = \"\", y= \"\") +\n  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(size=9, angle=60, hjust=1)) +\n  theme(legend.position = \"top\", legend.title.align=0.5, \n        legend.key.width = unit(2.6, \"cm\"), \n        legend.key.height = unit(0.3, \"cm\")) +\n  scale_fill_gradientn(colours = pal) +\n  guides(fill = guide_colorbar(title.position = \"top\", ))\n\n\npal <- wes_palette(\"Zissou1\", 100, type = \"continuous\")\n\ncountry_border <- cshp(date = as.Date(\"2019-12-31\"))\n\ncountry_border <- country_border %>% \n  mutate(region = countrycode(country_name, origin = 'country.name', destination = 'un.regionsub.name')) %>% \n  filter(region %in% c(\"Sub-Saharan Africa\", \"Northern Africa\"))\n  \nmap_1 <- epr_tgg %>% \n  group_by(gwgropd) %>% \n  summarise(tot_n_vntDV = sum(n_vntDV, na.rm = T)) %>% \n  mutate(tot_n_vntDV = as.numeric(log(tot_n_vntDV+1))) %>% \n  ggplot() + \n  geom_sf(data = country_border, color = \"black\", size = 0.5, fill = NA) +\n  geom_sf(aes(fill = tot_n_vntDV)) + \n  scale_fill_gradientn(colours = pal) +\n  theme_bw() +\n  theme(legend.position = \"none\")\n\n\n\nfigure_2 <- ggarrange(map_1, heat_ + font(\"x.text\", size = 10),\n                    ncol = 1, nrow = 2, labels=\"AUTO\")\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n![**Figure 2** - Vigilante activity across time and space on the African continent](figures/figure_3_heat_map.png)\n\n## Independent variables\n\n### State access\n\nState access in Africa is closely connected with the state's ability to physically reach its population. Here the character of a state's transportation network plays a vital role since it constitutes the foundational infrastructure that permits the state to build and maintain institutions that can ensure social order [@Muller-Crepon.etal2021: 568]. Following Müller-Crepon and Müller-Crepon *et. al.* measuring state accessibility is done based on the average travel time from a country's capital or regional capitals to individuals inside an ethnic group's settlement areas. This is calculated using a weighted population average that has the following mathematical form:\n\n$$\nstate\\space access_g = ln\\bigg(\\frac{1}{I_g}\\sum_{i=1}^{I_g}1+time_C,_i\\bigg)\n$$\n\nHere $time_C,_i$ denotes the travelling time from the country or regional capital, $C$, to an individual $i$ using the shortest possible path. $I_g$ enumerates individuals belonging to an ethnic settlement area ($g$), constituting the population weight used in the formula. Using a population-weighted mean ensures that the travelling time to more densely populated areas is weighted higher than that of sparsely populated ones. I log transform the measure, since it better captures the convex relationship between the capacity of the state to assert itself in an area and travelling time [@Muller-Crepon2021: 2]. To compute the formula gridded raster data on travelling times and population counts are used together with EPR polygons to devise the final measure. Data on travelling time is provided by Müller-Crepon, who uses digitised footpaths and road networks of Africa to estimate the travelling time from a given grid-cell to either the national or regional capital per year. The approach is similar to Google maps and considers the condition of roads when estimating travelling time [@Muller-Crepon2021]. The main advantage of this data source is the time scale of the data, as it allows us to investigate the within variation in our independent variable. Population data is provided by the WorldPop project that, through the use of UN population census data and covariates, is combined in a machine learning model so to be able to accurately estimate the number of people living inside an ethnic group's settlement area $I_g$ and the approximate location of individual group members $i$ per year [@WorldPop2018]. The thesis opts for the unconstrained version of the dataset that does not take into consideration settlement patterns when estimating population counts, as the accuracy of these data sources has been found to vary through time and between spatial units, thereby limiting the comparative potential of the analysis [@Stevens.etal2015].\\\nThe final measure based on travelling time from the national capital ranges from -0.58 to 4.12, where higher values indicate an increase in the mean travelling time to members of an ethnic group on a log scale.\n\n### Security environment\n\nMeasuring the security environment in which ethnic groups reside in, the number of violent encounters in neighbouring ethnic areas are used. Using ACLED data, a subset of violent encounters are chosen based on whether rebels, militias or other vigilante groups are involved in violence or one-sided violence against government forces, civilians or between the before mentioned groups. These encounters are chosen as research has highlighted that vigilante groups have, in a number of cases, been mobilised as a response to the activity level of these groups [@Zech2016; @Peic2021; @Jentzsch2022]. The number of violent encounters in neighbouring ethnic areas are applied, so to create a spatial lag of the average threat level in neighbouring ethnic groups' settlement area, thereby capturing the potential for aggression towards a given ethnic group. The spatial-lag is given by the following formula, where $N_g$ is the number of neighbouring ethnic groups and $activity_n$ is the activity level in each of the neighbouring areas ($n$).\n\n$$\n\\text{security environment} = \\frac{1}{N_g}\\sum_{i = 1}^{N_g}acitivity_n \n$$\n\n## Ability to conduct collective action\n\nTo gauge whether the community attributes, rules and norms relating to a given ethnic group, data on ethnic groups' traditional governance structures in Africa is applied. This data source originates from a web survey where a diverse set of experts on ethnic groups were asked to answer a series of questions about the group of their expertise. The questions revolve around the internal institutional structure of an ethnic group and their level of centralization, as well as their formal and informal interactions with state institutions.\n\n### Attributes of Community\n\nMeasuring whether ethnic groups have an institutional setting that can act as an organisational focal point to disperse information between members, the following collective decision-making bodies have been chosen:\n\n-   Council of elders\n-   Customary assembly\n-   Level of customary institution\n\nWhen it comes to the existence of cooperative arrangements between individuals in ethnic communities, the following unofficial and official functions of traditional organisations are chosen:\n\n-   Land administration\n-   Natural resource management\n-   Security matters, peace and order\n-   Dispute resolution\n-   Infrastructural provisions\n\nThe chosen components are all binary, indicating the presence of such a function. They are chosen on the ground on whether they are assessed as requiring cooperation between individuals.\n\n### Rules\n\nGauging the presence of rules and norms in a community, the following three binary questions regarding the presence of the bellow are chosen. They are chosen on the ground that they capture both informal and formal rules, but moreover that they have institutional bodies to enforce such rules.\n\n-   Whether ethnic groups have customary rules and norms\n-   Whether ethnic groups have customary courts\n-   Whether ethnic groups have mechanisms for dispute resolutions\n\n### Biophysical/ Material Conditions\n\nThe biophysical/material conditions of an ethnic community are measured using two measures.\\\nFirstly, when measuring the spatial dispersion of a group, this study follows the proposed method by Weidmann of how to calculate the degree that members of an ethnic group is dispersed. The central measure is denoted \"$D$\" where higher values correspond to more dispersed groups, and is calculated using the below formula:\n\n$$\n    D= \\frac{\\underset{i,j \\in\\{1..N\\}, i < j}{\\sum p(c_i) p(c_j) log(d(c_i,c_j))}}{\\underset{i,j \\in\\{1..N\\}, i < j}{\\sum p(c_i) p(c_j)}}\n$$\n\nUsing gridded population data from the WorldPop project, the formula uses the number of people inside each settlement cluster, denoted \"$P(C_n)$\" and the logged minimal geodesic distance between each cluster \"$d(…)$\". By computing a population-weighted average of the logged minimal geodesic distances between clusters, a measure is created where the distance between heavily populated clusters is weighted higher than that of sparsely populated ones [@Weidmann2009: 536]. The measure ranges from 0 to 6.31, where lower values indicate that ethnic groups are more centralised, whereas higher values indicates more dispersed ethnic groups.\n\nThe second measure captures to what extent an ethnic group is cultivating their land using irrigation techniques. The measure is devised using satellite data from *The Copernicus Climate Change Service* (CCI) on land use and population data from the WorldPop project. The land use data is generated using an algorithm that applies different satellites and machine learning classification techniques so to be able to generate yearly assessments of what a given grid-cell of land is being used for. Importantly for this study, the data records whether a grid-cell is classified as \"*Cropland, irrigated or post-flooding*\", indicating if irrigation is used as the primary cultivating technique in an area [@ESA2017]. The final measure is created by combining land use data, ethnic settlement areas and WorldPop population data, enabling the study to calculate the percentage of an ethnic group's members living in cropland areas being irrigated. Moreover, as it is not affected by the dependent variable i.e. conflict related violence, it is ensured that the measure does not induce a systematic bias in the final results [@Schultz.Mankin2019]. The scale of the measure ranges from 0% to 100% where higher values indicate that a larger share of members of an ethnic group living in areas being irrigated.\n\n# Designing the statistical model\n\nThe final data set consists of repeated counts of vigilante group activity in 196 ethnic groups within 37 African states from 2000 to 2016, resulting in 3009 group years. Working with count data, which show signs of overdispersion[^overdispersion], the analysis opt for a negative binomial probability distribution. Thus, I employ a negative binomial regression model that in its standard form can be seen bellow, where $\\mu$ is the mean, $\\alpha$ is the dispersion parameter, $X^T$ is a matrix of observations and their corresponding values on the variables used in the final model, and $\\beta$ is a vector of coefficient derived using maximum likelihood estimation. The NB1 parameterization is utilized to account for overdispersion. The NB1 parameterization assumes a linear relationship between the mean and variance of the outcome, as shown in the variance equation.\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\nY_i \\sim NB(\\mu_i, \\alpha) \\\\\nlog(\\mu_i) = X^T_i \\beta \\\\\nvar(Y_i) = \\mu_i+\\alpha\\mu_i\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\n\n[^overdispersion]: Overdispersion occurs when the variance of count data exceeds its mean, violating the Poisson distribution's assumption of equal mean and variance. This phenomenon often results from unobserved heterogeneity, data clustering, or excess zeros. Ignoring overdispersion can lead to underestimated standard errors and inflated test statistics, potentially causing false positive results. Negative binomial regression is a common approach to address overdispersion in count data analysis.\n\n\nFurthermore, the data structure allows the study to investigate the relationship using a hybrid-multilevel regression model that applies the causal identification strategy found in fixed-effects models while at the same time being able to take into account the nested structure of ethnic groups within countries [@Bell.etal2019; @Allison2005: 32; @Hamaker.Muthén2020; @Morgan2013: 118]. Central to this model is the decomposing of time-varying predictors into two parts; one representing the between-group variation, whereas the other representing the within-group variation. The between-group estimate is the specific mean for group $i$ on the time-varying predictors, which is denoted as: $\\overline{x_i}$, and captures the average effect between groups. The within estimator is calculated using the demeaned method where the time-varying predictor for group $i$ in year $t$ is subtracted from the group mean: $x_i,_t-\\overline{x_i}$ . This estimator is akin to the conditional estimator found in fixed-effect models and controls for unobserved time-invariant confounders [@Allison2005: 33; @Morgan2013: 118].\\\n\nWhen testing time-varying interaction effects in a hybrid multilevel framework two methods have been proposed. Firstly, Schunck argues that the product term between the dependent variable and the interaction variable for group $i$ in year $t$: $x_i,_tz_i,_t$ should as the main predictors, be decomposed into a between estimator, $\\overline{x_iz_i}$, and a within estimator: $x_i,_tz_i,_t-\\overline{x_iz_i}$ [@Schunck2013].\\\nOpposite to Schunk's approach, Giesselmann and Schmidt-Catran argue that this method will do fine when only the dependent variable is time-varying, but when the interaction term is also time-varying unobserved time-invariant confounders are not controlled for, thus the final estimate will be biased. To obtain an unbiased interaction term, they propose the double demean method where one takes the product between the two demeaned terms: $(x_i,_t-\\overline{x_i})(z_i,_t-\\overline{z_i})$. This product term should when be decomposed into a between term, $\\overline{(x_i,_t-\\overline{x_i})(z_i,_t-\\overline{z_i})}$, and a within component that controls for unobserved time-invariant confounders: $(x_i,_t-\\overline{x_i})(z_i,_t-\\overline{z_i})-\\overline{(x_i,_t-\\overline{x_i})(z_i,_t-\\overline{z_i})}$ [@Giesselmann.Schmidt-Catran2022].\\\nBased on the above, the analysis will rely on the double demeaned method, though as a sensitivity analysis the Schunck method will also be used.\n\nThe within estimator will not be able to control for time-varying confounders. As a result, omitted variable bias will be introduced in the analysis. In order to account for that, a series of time-varying confounders on both the group and state level are included in the analysis.\\\nOn the group level, the logged total population of an ethnic group is included, as it can be expected that more populous groups would be more able to mobilise vigilante groups since they have a larger pool of potential recruits that can be enrolled [@Neupert-Wentz2020]. Furthermore, it would seem reasonable to expect that areas, where more people are located are also the areas that will be prioritised by governmental infrastructural developers when considering the location of new roads. Thus, more populous areas are expected to have more developed road networks [@Burrier2019].\\\nThree other confounders are controlled for on the state level. Firstly, GDP per capita adjusted for inflation is included as it has been found to affect both vigilante mobilisation, road infrastructure and violence levels [@Dao2008; @Peic2021; @Collier.Hoeffler2004; @Fearon.Laitin2003]. Secondly, more democratic states are expected to affect vigilante mobilisation and violence in neighbouring ethnic areas through lower levels of violence inside a state's borders, which is opposite to autocratic states, which are generally connected with higher levels of violence [@Krishnarajan.etal2017]. Measuring the level of democracy is done using the V-dem egalitarian democracy index. The index captures whether a state can be considered an electoral democracy and, moreover, if resources and power are distributed eq\"\"ually among groups [@Coppedge2021]. Thirdly, to account for the general conflict level in a state, a binary measure of whether there is ongoing conflict within a state is provided by the UCDP armed conflict database [@Sundberg.Melander2013]. Its inclusion ensures that the effect on vigilante mobilisation is not a response to the general security situation in the state, as it seems reasonable that both violence in neighbouring ethnic areas and road infrastructure are affected by the overall conflict level in a state.

The estimated effects are presented on a multiplicative scale by converting them to *Incidence Ratio Rates* (IRR) using the exponent of the estimates ($e^\\beta$) and on an additive scale by calculating the *Average Marginal Effect* (AME) [@Hoffmann2016: 137-138; @Buis2010]. In all models, confounders are included.\\\nThe between estimator is denoted \"*M*\" and the within estimator is denoted \"*DM*\". The analysis will primarily focus on the within estimators as they are less affected by omitted variable bias. However, the between effect should not be discarded as it illuminates on average, how much does ethnic groups differ on the same independent variable. Thereby, allowing the thesis to understand the contextual effects of the independent variables, for instance, the effect of groups being situated in general more hostile security environments [@Bell.etal2019; @Hamaker.Muthén2020; @Howard2015].\\\nAs the estimation of confidence intervals in non-linear multilevel models rests on a series of assumptions, which are commonly violated due to the complex structure of the model [@Thai.etal2014; @Meijler.etal1998], confidence intervals are derived using parametric bootstrapping with 500 iterations.\\\\\n\n\n\nThe statistical result can be seen in table 2. Firslty, it is worth noting that in all three models, the estimate of a yearly increase from 2000 to 2016 is associated with a significant positive effect on vigilante activity. In model 3, which controls for both for the main independent variables and confounders, a yearly increase in the studied period is associated with an increase in the IRR of 1.12 or an AME of 15% in expected vigilante group activity. This result indicates that throughout the studied period, vigilante groups have become more active on the African continent.\\\nTurning to the effect of the state's ability to be present in ethnic settlement areas investigated in model 1, both the between and the within estimates have a positive effect. This indicates that when the mean travelling time from the state capital to members of an ethnic group increases, vigilante groups become more active. Though, only the between estimate is significantly different from zero. As a result, the analysis is only able to establish that there are signs of a significant positive difference of 1.030 in the expected log count of vigilante activity. This effect corresponds to an IRR increase by a factor of 2.801 and an AME of 141% when moving from ethnic groups where on average the state easily can assert itself to groups located in areas that are less accessible. The confidence interval for the effect ranges from 0.36 to 1.67 on a log-scale, which is quite substantial. Though, as noted above, this estimate does not control for unobserved time-invariant confounders on the group level, hence we are unable to ensure that this relationship is not spurious.\\\nA possible explanation for the difference between the between estimate and the within estimate could possibly be due to the short time frame of the study. Because of the slow construction time associated with infrastructure projects, sufficient variation in the within estimate cannot be established.\\\n\nSecondly, looking at model 1, it becomes apparent that both the between and the within estimates of a change in security environments becoming more insecure has a significant positive effect on the activity level of vigilante groups. Thereby, a unit increase in the mean activity level of neighboring conflict actors, is associated with an increase of 0.002 in the expected difference in the logs of the expected activity level of vigilante groups, while holding the other variables in the model constant. Using IRR it becomes evident that this effect is akin to a 1.002 factor increase in vigilante activity or an AME of 0.3%, which is a small effect. The confidence interval attests that the within effect is borderline significant.\\\n\n\n\n:::\n\n::: {#second-column}\n\n```{=html}\n<html>\n<head>\n<meta http-equiv=\"content-type\" content=\"text/html;

However, the effect of the interaction term, *SADM X Collective institution*, runs counter to the theoretical expectation. Because the effect of state access on vigilante activity decreases with -3.682 on a log scale equivalent to an IRR of 0.025 or a 97% decrease with a unit increase on the collective institution measure. The confidence interval for the effect is estimated to be between -7.06 and -0.77 on a log-scale. Indicating, that collective institutions have a hampering effect on communities' ability to mobilize vigilante groups. This is a perplexing finding that illuminates that locale institutions affect collective action, though more work is needed in order to understand which parts of an institution and how they affect collective action.\n\n:::\n\n::::\n\nTurning to the effect of the biophysical/material indicators investigated in models 5 to 9, we see again that only the effect of state access is affected significantly. The interaction term *SADM X Irrigated pop DM* measures how the within effect of state access changes with a within change in the share of people living in irrigated areas. The interaction term is negative and statistically significant. This relationship is modelled in model 5, which estimates that a 1% increase in the share of ethnic members living in irrigated areas is associated with a -33.99 decrease in the effect of state access on expected vigilante group activity on a log-scale. The effect is estimated to range from -54.58 to -22.98 on a log-scale, and corresponds to an IRR of $0.2^{10^{-16}}$ or an AME of -52.8%. Thereby being a substantial effect.\\\nThe effect is depicted in figure 5, which shows the estimated level of vigilante group activity with a change in state access conditioned on whether 0%, 1% or 2% of members of an ethnic group live in irrigated areas. Despite the large confidence interval, it becomes clear that only groups who do not live in areas being irrigated will mobilise vigilante groups when the state is absent. This finding goes against the theoretical expectation, which might be due to the fact that the irrigation measure is instead capturing another phenomenon, such as the degree of land inequality and locale authoritarianism [@Bentzen.etal2012], the degree of institutionalism in an area [@Asrat.Anteneh2019] or drought in an area. Though it is unclear how these variables would affect vigilante group mobilisation.\\\nRegarding the interaction effect between population dispersion and the two independent variables investigated in model 6 and 9, the conditioning effect is estimated to have a positive effect on state access and a negative impact on the effect of the security environment. However, both effects are statistically insignificant.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n##### Interaction hypothesis \n\n### Model 4\nmulti_neg_v4 <- glmmTMB(n_vntDV~ time + TTc_M + TTc_DM +

if the analytical choices made regarding model specification and operationalisation are sensitive to a change in configuration, the study conducts a series of sensitivity analyses.\\\nFirstly, table 4 shows three hybrid-multilevel logistic regression models fitted to the same data set as the analysis, but where the dependent variable has been dichotomised so that it only measures whether vigilante groups are not present or present in a given year.\\\nSimilar to model 2 in table 3, we see that the positive but non-significant effect of an increase in the mean travel time from the capital to ethnic settlement areas is still valid in model 10, as a one unit increase is associated with a positive increase in the probability of vigilante groups appearing. Moreover, looking at model 11, it becomes apparent that here too there is a positive but a significant effect of the security environment becoming more hostile.\\\nTesting if reporting bias affects the interaction hypothesis, table 2 in appendix 2 investigates whether the findings in table 4 in the analysis change when using the dichotomised dependent variable. Here we see that the interaction effects *SADM X Collective institution* and *SADM X Irrigated pop DM* both become insignificant, indicating that reporting bias might be affecting this area of the analysis.\nIt could be argued that the above result is instead a product of the change in functional form from a negative binomial to a logistic form. In order to assess whether that is the case, four specification curve analyses are performed regarding how a change in functional form affects the results relating to the effect of state presence and the security environment and the two before mentioned interaction terms. In these analyses, different regression models are fitted to the original dataset using the following four functional forms:\n\n1.  Hybrid-multilevel model using a Poisson distribution (*ML poisson*)\n2.  Hybrid-multilevel model using a Negative Ninomial distribution (*ML negative binomial*)\n3.  Linear hybrid-multilevel model where vigilante group activity is on a log-scale (*ML linear (log)*)\n4.  A three-way linear fixed effect model where vigilante group activity is on a log-scale (*FE linear (log)*)\n\nBesides varying the functional form, the analyses also investigate how changing which confounders are included affects the result. Only the models where all confounders are included will be considered in this section.\\\nFigure 4.A1 depicts the specification curve relating to the effect of a change in the security environment, and the interaction hypothesis *SADM X Irrigated pop DM* is shown in figure 4.A2.\\\nLooking at plot 6.A1, we see that changing the functional form of the model only has a limited effect on the final results regarding the effect of the security environment since all models estimate the within effect to be between 0.0021 and 0.0031 on a log-scale, and be significantly different from zero.\\\n:::\n::::\nA different pattern emerges when it comes to the within effect of state access, which is depicted in figure 1 in appendix 2. Here both ML negative binomial and FE linear (log) estimates an insignificant effect of 0.2, whereas ML Poisson and ML linear (log) estimate a significant effect spanning from 0.2 to 4. Moreover, changing the state access measure to one where transport time is calculated from the regional capital (SADM (regional)) instead of the national capital also has a major impact on the final result, as all models with the exception of the FE linear (log) estimates a significant effect ranging from 0.3 to 4.9. Thereby, lending support to hypothesis 1.\\\nMoving to plot A2 in figure 4, depicting a specification curve for the interaction term *SADM X Irrigated pop DM* two surprising results becomes apparent. Firstly, the choice of functional form has a noteworthy effect on the effect size, as the nonlinear models estimate a significant effect ranging from -38.4 to -28.6. In contrast, the linear models estimate it to be around 1, and it is only significant when estimated using ML linear (log). Secondly, it also becomes apparent that how the interaction term is created affects whether the effect of the interaction term becomes negative or positive. When the interaction term is calculated using the double de-meaned method it becomes negative, whereas when using the de-meaned method it becomes positive. A similar effect of the choice of functional form is also seen when it comes to the effect size of the interaction term *SADM X Collective institution*, which is depicted in figure 2 appendix 2.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r

and the security environment are not affected by reporting bias. Though there are indications of it affecting the estimation of the interaction hypotheses. However, the method used to assess whether reporting bias is present is not able to discern between if it is reporting bias or the change in the functional form of the statistical model that is affecting the final results. In order to understand whether that is the case, a series of specification curve analyses were conducted, making it possible to assess if a change in the functional form, number of confounders, national or regional capital and how the interaction term is created affects the final results.\\\nOverall, the significant effect of a change in the security environment is the most robust finding in this study. When it comes to the effect of state access, changing the functional form has an effect on the estimated size and significance level. Most noteworthy calculating state access using regional capitals instead of only the national ones has a substantial effect on the findings of the analysis. Furthermore, both functional form and how interaction effects are created also have a substantial effect on the findings of this study. Firstly, it indicates that we should be conscious of how to assess interaction hypotheses in linear and nonlinear models. Secondly, these results do not mean that the double de-meaned estimator is a misspecification, actually the opposite as the non-double de-meaned estimator estimates a positive effect, which conflicts with the graphical representation in figure 5.\n\n# Conclusion\n\nThis analysis has tried to understand what determines the activity level of vigilante groups across the African continent. To the author's knowledge, a similar study in relation to the number of cases and time frame of this phenomenon has not been conducted before.\\\nUnderstanding this actor is important as vigilante groups have increasingly become an important supplier of security in African security markets, especially in areas of failed states. Despite this, comparative research regarding this actor is sparse. Moreover, research has a tendency to lump vigilante groups together with militias and view vigilante groups as governments' extended arm used for the projection of state power.\\\nTherefore, this thesis has based on litterateur on vigilante groups and militias developed a definition of vigilante groups being mobilised from the bottom-up, and not being interested in revolutionary change or government takeover, but instead in security.\n\nTwo hypotheses relating to the effect of the state's presence and the security environment on vigilante group appearance have been developed. Moreover, it is theorised that as vigilante groups are mobilised from the bottom-up, the effect of the two proposed hypotheses is conditioned on whether locale communities are able to overcome the collective action problem, and, thereof be successful in mobilising vigilante groups.\\\nUsing Ostrom's and colleagues' IAD framework together with theories on collective action, a novel measure of communities' ability to overcome the collective action problem has been derived. It focuses on how attributes and the rules of communities, and the biophysical/material environment in which they are situated in, jointly constitute a latent variable determining communities' ability to perform collective action. An important benefit of using a multi-dimensional measure, is that it does not focus on a single attribute as being the decisive component fostering collective action in communities but instead views it as a multifaceted phenomenon where different attributes through different mechanisms increase the likelihood that members of a community will work together instead of free-riding.\\\n\nEthnic settlement areas are applied as the main unit of analysis, thereby more accurately representing the theoretical mechanisms. Data sources relating to vigilante activity level, transportation time, population counts, satellite data on land use, and traditional institutions are combined with ethnic settlement areas to create a unique locale data set.\\\nApplying this data set, the empirical validity of the proposed measure of communities' ability to conduct collective action is tested using CFA. The analysis rejects the existence of a single latent dimension shared by all the measures, as the biophysical/material measures do not capture the same dimension as the other measures. Instead, the study uncovers that the measures related to community attributes and customary rules are all manifestations of the same latent variable, and therefore are used to create a measure denoted collective institutions.\\\nThe biophysical/material measures relating to how agricultural practises, in the form of irrigation, nurture cooperation, and population dispersion, are moreover found to each be measuring their own unique phenomena.\\\nThe results of this analysis constitute an important starting point on how comparative research can develop more encompassing measures of how the structures, both social and natural, of ethnic communities either foster or hamper collective action, instead of just relying on single attributes. However, more research is needed in this area in order to fully understand the nature of this phenomenon.\n\nThe hypotheses are tested using a longitudinal hybrid-multilevel regression model. A core advantage of this model is that it allows the thesis to control for unobserved time-invariant confounders while at the same time taking into account how ethnic groups are nested within countries. This approach thereby ensures the causal validity of the estimates in the analysis.\\\nInvestigating the effect of the state's ability to access territory and thereby be active in the market for security, the analysis fails to establish a significant causal link. Indicating that when the state is unable to provide security in an area, civilians will not, as a response, begin to provide for their own security by the formation of vigilante groups. Although there are signs of a significant and positive effect when comparing ethnic groups' mean level across the studied period. Furthermore, when using regional capitals instead of national ones in the calculation of state access, a significant causal effect is established. A possible reason for these mixed result, could be due to the short period analysed, which limits the amount of variation needed.\\\nOpposite to the effect of state access, a significant and positive effect of security environments becoming more hostile is established. Thereby, when civilians find themselves in more insecure security markets, they are more likely to establish vigilante groups to provide for their own security. Thereby stipulating that civilians do not just choose non-violent tactics when responding to insecurity and threats, but will actively opt for violent ones as a way to cope with hostile security environments. Indicating civilian agency in violent conflicts. Though, the effect is fairly small and borderline significant.\n\nExploring if the effects of state access and the security environment are conditioned on ethnic communities' collective institutions and the biophysical/material environment they reside in, the analysis finds that it is only the effect of state access that significantly is being altered. Though the effects run counter the theoretical expectations. Because the analysis exposes that communities characterised by having strong collective institutions characterised by cooperation and rules fostering collective action will significantly be less likely to mobilise vigilante groups when state access diminishes. The same trend is also present when it comes to the biophysical/material measure of how the agricultural practice of irrigation affects vigilante mobilisation. These results are perplexing, and highlights the need for more research relating to both collective action and the collective act of mobilising vigilante groups.\n\nA series of sensitivity analyses were performed, in order to understand if the results obtained from the analysis are robust to the different analytical choices made in the analysis. Most noteworthy is that the estimated effect size and significant level of the interaction terms are very volatile to a change in the functional form of the statistical model and the method used to calculate such terms. For this reason one should be careful when interpreting the results of the conditioning effect of communities ability to conduct collective action. This finding calls for closer scrutiny of the debated issue of how to include interaction effects in especially nonlinear statistical models.\n\nLastly, the study has uncovered that an unknown time varying variable has a substantial and significant effect on the emergence of vigilante groups. Because a yearly increase from the beginning of studied period to its end, is strongly related to an increase in vigilante group activity. Highlighting that more research is needed to uncover what is driving this trend.\n\nWinding up, this analysis has come closer to understanding in which contexts vigilante groups will appear and how active they will be. There is however, still unexplored areas related not only to what drives vigilante group mobilisation, but also how they affect conflicts and civilian casualties. Because will the presence of vigilante groups prolong conflicts as they are essentially a sign that civil society has become militarised? [@Osorio.etal2021]. Moreover, will their embeddedness in communities due to their bottom-up mobilisation mean that they will be less hostile towards civilians, which evidence from Afghanistan indicates [@Dearing2021: 15], or will they be used to oppress for instance sub-ethnic groups?\n\n# The original analysis and appendix\nThe original study and the appendix can be accessed [here](media/speciale_Erik_H_Knudsen_2022.pdf).\n",
